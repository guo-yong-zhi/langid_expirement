The Vedeneyev M14P is a Russian nine-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, petrol-powered radial engine.  Producing 360 hp , its design dates from the 1940s , and is itself a development of the Ivchenko AI-14 engine.  The engine has been used extensively by the Yakovlev and Sukhoi Design Bureaus. The M14P is also used in some experimental aircraft and kit designs such as the Murphy Moose, Radial Rocket, Pitts Model 12, and others.
The M14PF is a 400 hp  version of the M14P.
The engine's intake system uses a gear driven supercharger and an automatic-mixture type carburetor. Power is transmitted to the propeller via a reduction gearbox.
In addition to the carburetor, the engine has a speed governor, two magnetos, mechanical fuel pump, generator, and an oil pump. It is started pneumatically, and remains fully operational during inverted flight.  Unlike most American piston-type aero-engines, which turn to the right  when viewed from the cockpit, the M14P rotates to the left , like most British-designed radials of the World War II era.
A factory modification to the supercharger gearing results in the engine producing 400 hp, while non-factory modifications have it producing as much as 460 hp.  Such non-factory engines may also incorporate other upgrades, such as electric starters and electronic ignition.
When operated in a certified aircraft, the TBO  for the M14P engine is 750 hours initially, and every 500 hours thereafter. On experimental aircraft, the engines are often run to their complete 2250-hour design life before overhaul citation needed .
The M14-V26 variant has been developed exclusively for the Kamov Ka-26, where "V" stands for vertolet  and "26" for Ka-26.  Power is rated at 239 kW  for take-off. The engine has no integral gearbox; instead, the power is transmitted to the main reduction gearbox via an interconnect shaft.
It currently seems to be manufactured only at Voronezh Mechanical Plant. 1 
"Vedeneyev's first engine was the AI-14RF, which produced 300 hp and this in turn led to the M14P, which was introduced in its Series I form in the early 1970s. This produced 360 hp, and Series II came out in the early 1980s, still delivering 360 hp, but with a variety of small internal improvements." 2 
The Laros design bureau, building the Laros-31 aerobatic sports airplane, plans to transfer the assembly of the M14 from Romania to Russia.  3
