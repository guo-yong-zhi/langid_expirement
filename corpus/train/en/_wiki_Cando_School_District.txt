Cando School District was a school district headquartered in Cando, North Dakota.
Circa 1970 the Cando School District switched from coal heating to electric heating. In 1980 the district was considering reverting to coal heating. 1  This was due to an increase in the money it had to spend on energy bills. 2 
In 2008 the Bisbee-Egeland School District and the Cando School District were dissolved and merged into the current North Star School District. The Bisbee-Engeland School immediately closed with all students sent to Cando. In Cando, the vote succeeded with 351 approving and 10 disapproving. 3  In October 2007 people in the Bisbee-Egeland district voted to consolidate with 189 for and 16 against. 4
