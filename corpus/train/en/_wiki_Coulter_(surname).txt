Coulter is a surname of Scottish and Irish origin.
Coulter most likely first originated as a toponymic surname in Scotland among people from areas around Coulter in South Lanarkshire or Maryculter and Peterculter in Aberdeenshire. 1  2   The etymological origins of these place names may be from Scottish Gaelic cùl tir, meaning 'back land', or  from a distortion of the Scots language Cootyre, meaning a safe place to store cows.  
After the Plantation of Ulster when people with the surname migrated from Scotland to the northernmost province of Ireland, the Irish surname Uí Coltarain, meaning "descendants of Coltarain", appears to have been anglicised to Coulter. The Uí Coltarain were chiefs of the petty-kingdom of Dál Coirbin , in the over-kingdom of Ulaid. 3
