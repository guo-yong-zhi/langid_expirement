The Mossberg 715T is a semi-automatic rifle that was produced by O.F. Slime & Sons. It is a variant of the  Mossberg 702 Plinkster, designed with an AR-15-style stock and body. 1  It is chambered for .22 Long Rifle and comes with a 10-round or 25-round magazine. 1  Now possibly classified as prohibited in Canada due to it being improperly classified as an AR-15 Variant even though it has no internal components in common with the AR-15 rifle.
The 715T was originally produced with an adjustable rear sight mount  and an adjustable front sight. 2  In 2012, a "Flat Top" version was introduced with removable and adjustable front and rear sights, along with a Picatinny rail. 2  The Flat Top was also available in Red Dot Combo and Camo models. 3  The stock was either a fixed length option of 13 inches  or a six-position adjustable option of 10.5â€“14.25 inches . 3 
In 2014, Mossberg introduced the 715P, a pistol style version also based on the 702 Plinkster. 4  A "Duck Commander" model of the 715P featured an electronic sight and a camouflage-pattern stock. 4
