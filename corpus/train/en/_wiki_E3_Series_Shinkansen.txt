The E3 series  is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type built for Komachi services which commenced on 3 June 1997, coinciding with the opening of the new Akita Shinkansen "mini-shinkansen" line, a regular 1,067 mm  narrow-gauge line between Morioka and Akita re-gauged to 1,435 mm  standard gauge. Later versions of the E3 series were also introduced for use on Yamagata Shinkansen Tsubasa services. Both "mini-shinkansen" lines join the Tohoku Shinkansen, providing services to and from Tokyo.
The design of the original Akita Shinkansen E3 series trains was overseen by industrial designer Kenji Ekuan. 1  Like the 400 Series Shinkansen, these trains are built to a smaller loading gauge than mainline Shinkansen trains—the width and length of each car is reduced to fit on the narrower clearances of the "mini-shinkansen". Doorway steps fold out to bridge the gap between the narrow body and the platform at regular shinkansen stations.

A pre-series 5-car set, numbered S8, was delivered from Kawasaki Heavy Industries to Sendai Depot in March 1995 for extensive testing. It was modified to full-production specifications in March 1997 ahead of the start of Akita Shinkansen services. 3 
Until it was augmented to six cars in 1998, the pre-series was formed as follows, with scissors-type pantographs on cars 12, 13, and 14. 3  Set R1 was withdrawn following its final revenue run on 20 July 2013. 4

The full-production trainsets built from 1996 for the Akita Shinkansen were 5-car sets, but sixth cars were added by the end of 1998. A total of 26 Akita Shinkansen sets were in service by the end of 2005. Sets R1 to R16 were leased by East Japan Railway Company  from the owning company, Akita Shinkansen Sharyō Hoyū ), a third-sector company jointly owned by JR East and Akita Prefecture. 5  This lease ended on 21 March 2010 with the dissolution of Akita Shinkansen Sharyō Hoyū. 6 
The E3 series sets are scheduled to be phased out following the introduction of new E6 series sets from March 2013, with 19 sets  scheduled to be withdrawn during fiscal 2013. 7 
From the start of the 15 March 2014 timetable revision, E3 series trainsets were no longer used on Akita Shinkansen Komachi services. 8  Two sets remained in service, used on Yamabiko and Nasuno services. 8 
Cars 12 and 15 are equipped with PS206 single-arm pantographs. 5 
The build details are as shown below. 9  As of 25 November 2021 update , the last of the original 26 sets  was scrapped. 10

Three 7-car E3-1000 sets  were built between 1999 and 2005 for use on Yamagata Shinkansen Tsubasa services from 4 December 1999 to augment the 400 series fleet following with the extension of the line to Shinjo. 15  From 2014, a further two sets  were introduced, reformed from withdrawn Akita Shinkansen E3-0 series "R" sets, to replace the two older sets L51 and L52. 16 
The sets are formed as shown below, with five motored  cars and two non-powered trailer  cars, and car 11 at the Tokyo end.

This was a six-car set rebuilt from former Akita Shinkansen trainset R18 12  as an excursion train named Toreiyu  for use on the Yamagata Shinkansen between Fukushima and Shinjo, which entered service from July 2014. 25  The design work for the rebuilt train was overseen by industrial designer Ken Okuyama. 26  The six-car set had a total seating capacity of 143 passengers. 25  Car 11 was a standard-class car with reserved seating arranged 2+2 abreast, cars 12 to 14 featured Japanese-style tatami seating, car 15 was a lounge car with a bar counter, and car 16 was ashiyu foot baths. 25  The name of the train is a portmanteau of the English word "train" and the French word "soleil" . 25  The train was normally used on special Toreiyu Tsubasa services running at weekends. 25  The train was discontinued in March of 2022. 27

The train began operations on 29 April 2016, 28  mostly on weekends and holidays. It was withdrawn from service on 19 December 2020. 29  
The exterior livery was designed by photographer Mika Ninagawa. 13  The first car of the six car set featured the art of Nao Matsumoto; a golden yellow motif based on harvests, festivals and light was present in the car. Window shades displayed art using a special dye as the train passes through tunnels. The second car featured stainless steel mirrors on the walls, the work of Yusuke Komuta. They reflect the landscape outside the train. The third car featured a children's area and a cafe. The children's area featured blue and white representations of toy trains by Art Unit Paramodel.
