Gastrochilus distichus has slim, clustered pendants with its branches stems enveloped by leaf bearing sheaths. Stems carry several narrow, two-ranked, stalkless, and long pointed fleshy leaves. The plant blooms in spring on a leaf opposed, hairless, slender, raceme-like, 2-4 flowered, more or less sigmoid-shaped inflorescence with 2 distant, lanceolate, basally tubular bracts and oblong, subacute floral bracts. The flowers are light green with reddy-brown spots. Sepals are similar, usually concave, oblong-elliptic, 4.5-5 × 2.5–3 mm, apex obtuse. Petals are somewhat obovate, slightly smaller than sepals, tip blunt, lip with an epichile and a saccate hypochile. Epichile is nearly suborbicular, about 3 × 5 mm, adaxially hairless, with a central cushion, near base with 2 conic calli, entire, obtuse at apex. Hypochile is subcupular, about 4 mm tall, 2–3 mm in diameter, apex rounded. 4
