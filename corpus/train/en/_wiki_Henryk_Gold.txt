Henryk Gold  was a Polish-born American composer, arranger, and orchestra director.
He was born in Warsaw to a musical family: his mother Helena was of the famous Warsaw klezmer Melodysta family, and his father Michael was a flautist in the Warsaw Opera Orchestra.  He was the brother of Artur Gold.  He studied in Warsaw, his teachers including Stanisław Barcewicz .
When silent movies in Poland lost popularity following the arrival of Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer, , thousands of Polish musicians who'd played in the movie theaters lost their livelihood; they began to create large and small orchestras playing dance music and jazz. 1  Artur and Henryk Gold, the brothers Jerzy and Stanislaw Petersburski, Zygmunt Karasinski and Szymon Kataszek, Kazimierz Englard, Julian Halicki were the pioneers; Henryk Gold was chief among them, giving concerts at the famous Ziemiańska Cafe on Kredytowa Street and the revue theater "Morskie-Oko" on Sienkiewicz Street. He ran the nightclub "Adria" with his brother on Moniuszki Street. 2 
Gold wrote hundreds of tangos, polkas, foxtrots, and waltzes, interpolating Jewish motifs. His hits included Tęsknota ; Jaśminy ; Jak ja się dziś upiję ; Moja pierswsza i ostatnia ; Szkoda twoich łez , and others. 3 
During the Second World War, he and fellow composer Jerzy Petersburski toured the Soviet Union with a large jazz orchestra. In 1942 he left the Soviet Union with the Polish Anders Army, went to Israel, where he wrote songs "Arcenu ha-ktantonet", "Ruakh", "Shalom" and lastly emigrated to New York City, United States. 3
