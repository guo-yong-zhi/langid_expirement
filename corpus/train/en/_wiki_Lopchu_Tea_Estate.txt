Lopchu Tea Estate is a tea garden in the Rangli Rangliot CD block in the Darjeeling Sadar subdivision of the Darjeeling district in the Indian state of West Bengal.
"Lopchu" is a derivative from Lepcha language, which prevailed in the area when the garden was set up. 1 
Lopchu Tea Estate was owned by British planters, possibly the Langmore family, in its earlier days. 2  The garden was established in the early 1860s. 3 
In 1954, Lopchu Tea Estate was purchased by S.N.Kanoria and G.L.Kanoria, two cousins and both jute traders. Now, their grandsons, Rajesh Kanoria and Sandeep Kanoria, own the garden. 1  4
