The Judiciary of Macau is responsible for the administration of justice in Macau. It hears all prosecutions and civil disputes, including disputes between individuals and the government. It is fundamental to Macauâ€™s legal system that members of the judiciary are independent of the executive and legislative branches of the government. 1  The courts of law in Macau comprise the Court of Final Appeal  and 11 other courts. The President of the Court of Final Appeal of the Macau Special Administrative Region is head of the judiciary. A bilingual court system in which Chinese, Portuguese or both can be used was put in place, in accordance with the requirement of the Basic Law.
Each court is headed by a chief judge or President. 1 
Judges of Macau are appointed by the Chief Executive of Macau with recommendation of an independent commission composed of local judges, lawyers and eminent persons. Most judges are local Macanese, but foreign judges maybe appointed.
Judges in Macau wear a simple dark gray/off black robe with a dark sash. Some judges have colour cuffs and waist bands . Suits are worn underneath. It is similar to those worn by Portuguese judges.
