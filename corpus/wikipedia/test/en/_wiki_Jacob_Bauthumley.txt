Jacob Bauthumley or Bottomley 1   was an English radical religious writer, usually identified as a central figure among the Ranters. He served as part of the New Model Army, leaving in March 1650. After the Restoration of 1660, he took up a job as a librarian in Leicester, where he produced a book of extracts from John Foxe, published in 1676.
Bauthumley is known principally for The Light and Dark Sides of God . This work was regarded as blasphemous for its pantheistic tendencies, including the following:
Nay, I see that God is in all Creatures, Man and Beast, Fish and Fowle, and every green thing, from the highest Cedar to the Ivey on the wall; and that God is the life and being of them all, and that God doth really dwell, and if you will personally; ... and hath his Being no where else out of the Creatures. 2 After the Blasphemy Act of August 1650, he was arrested, convicted, and burned through the tongue. 2 
Bauthumley had served in the Parliamentarian Army; 3  Norman Cohn 4  states that he was in the Army while writing the pamphlet, and took part in Ranter and Quaker meetings in Leicestershire in the mid-1650s. Christopher Hill 5  says that he left the Army in March 1650. His family had earlier suffered ostracism, for permitting sermons by Jeremiah Burroughes to be said in their house; 6  he was a shoemaker.
After the Restoration of 1660 he was a librarian in Leicester. He produced a book of extracts from John Foxe, published in 1676. 3 
Bauthumley denied that the Bible was the Word of God, 7  and that Christ was more divine than other men. 8  He considered that the real Devil lay in human nature, 9  while God dwells in the flesh of man. 10 
Historian E. P. Thompson calls his views 'quasi-pantheistic' in their re-definition of God and Christ, and quotes A. L. Morton to the effect that this is the central Ranter doctrine. 11
