In the 1985 state elections, Reul gained a seat in the State Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia and occupied it for 19 years. 3  In parliament, he was his political group's spokesperson on education policy from 1985 to 1991. Between 1991 and 2003, he served as Secretary General of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia, under the leadership of successive chairmen Norbert Blüm  and Jürgen Rüttgers . 4 
Reul first became a Member of the European Parliament in the 2004 European elections. During his time in parliament, he was a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

From 2012, Reul was a member of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula. He had previously been a member of the delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China between 2004 and 2012.
In addition to his committee assignments, Reul was a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Long Term Investment and Reindustrialisation, 6  the Sky and Space Intergroup  7  and the European Parliament Intergroup on Climate Change, Biodiversity and Sustainable Development.
Reul was widely regarded as one of the driving forces behind blocking Martin Schulz’ reelection as President of the European Parliament in early 2017. 8 
From the North Rhine-Westphalia state elections in 2017, Reul served as State Minister for Internal Affairs in the government of Minister-President Armin Laschet. 9  He succeeded Ralf Jäger. As one of his state's representatives at the Bundesrat, he is a member of the Committee on Internal Affairs and of the Defence Committee. 10 
During his time in office, Reul oversaw investigations into the 2018 Münster attack 11  and the Bottrop and Essen car attack in 2018/2019. 12  In 2020, he ordered an investigation into police officers’ use of force following a public outcry over a video of a police officer detaining a minor by kneeling on his neck. 13 
Since 2021, Reul has been serving as deputy chair of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia, under the leadership of chair Hendrik Wüst. 14  That same year, he announced his intention to run for a seat in the State Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia in the 2022 state elections. 15 
Reul was a CDU delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2017 and 2022. 16  Since 2012, he has been serving on the Presidium of the CDU, under the leadership of successive chairs Angela Merkel (2012–2018), Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (2018–2021) and Armin Laschet (2021). In the negotiations to form a Grand Coalition of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) together with the Bavarian CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) following the 2013 German elections, he led the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on banking regulation and the Eurozone; his co-chair from the SPD was Martin Schulz. 17 
Together with Frank Henkel, Peter Hintze, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Christine Lieberknecht, David McAllister and Annette Widmann-Mauz, Reul co-chaired the CDU’s 2014 national convention in Berlin. 18 
Ahead of the Christian Democrats’ leadership election in 2018, Reul publicly endorsed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Angela Merkel as the party's chair. 19 
Shortly after the CDU donations scandal and amid the campaign for the state elections in 2000, Reul became the target of public criticism when he – in his capacity as Secretary General of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia – had his party pay for a private trip to the Bayreuth Festival. 25
