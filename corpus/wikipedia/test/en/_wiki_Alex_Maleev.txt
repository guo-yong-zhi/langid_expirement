Alex Maleev  is a Bulgarian comic book illustrator, best known for the Marvel Comics' series Daredevil  with frequent collaborator Brian Michael Bendis. 1 
Coming from a fine arts background, Maleev made his first foray into comics in Bulgaria for Godan  and Carthel of Dead published in Riko magazine since 1991 and 1992, respectively. Upon arriving in the United States in 1995, he enrolled at The Kubert School where, within a month, he was promoted from first to second year status at the suggestion of instructor Alec Stevens.  Maleev left the school in early 1996, already securing professional comics work on James O'Barr's The Crow  and subsequently storyboarding the "Lost in Space" film at Continuity Associates before entering a successful run at DC Comics on Batman: No Man's Land.  In his comics, he sometimes references his Bulgarian origins. For example in Aliens vs. Predator alien eggs are stored in the cellar of a typical Bulgarian church.
He first teamed with Bendis on Todd McFarlane's Sam and Twitch series in 2000-2001 before they were recruited for Daredevil. In 2006, Maleev finished his run with Bendis in Daredevil and planned a collaboration with the writer on a new ongoing Spider-Woman series.  Bendis and Maleev collaborated once again on the much delayed four part Halo: Uprising miniseries from Marvel Comics. Bendis and Maleev relaunched Moon Knight in 2011 with volume 4, 2  and are currently working on the creator owned comic Scarlet, under the Marvel imprint Icon Comics.
Maleev also did art for the "New Avengers: Illuminati" special, the January 2007 issue of the New Avengers, issue #26 and the one-shots, Civil War: The Confession and Secret Invasion: Dark Reign.
He also did the artwork for the character Sylar on the TV show Heroes.  Often blending photographic and digital effects with drawing in his comics art, as with his work on Daredevil, citation needed  as well as watercolors and gouache, as on Spider-Woman. citation needed
