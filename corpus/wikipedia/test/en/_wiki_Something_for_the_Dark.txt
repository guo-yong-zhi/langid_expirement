Something for the Dark is an orchestral composition written in 2016 by the American composer Sarah Kirkland Snider. The work was commissioned by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra as a result of Snider receiving the 2014 Elaine Lebenbom Award for Female Composers. Its world premiere was given by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra conducted by Giancarlo Guerrero on April 14, 2016. 1 
Something for the Dark lasts about 12 minutes and is cast in a single movement. The title of the piece comes from the closing line of the 1961 poem "For Fran," written by the Detroit-born former United States Poet Laureate Philip Levine. 1  2 
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, Cor anglais, three clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano , harp, and strings. 1 
Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim of The New York Times described it as a "sophisticated piece," writing, "repetition transforms the emotional charge of musical motifs. A turn of phrase may appear pretty at first, then take on shades of nostalgia before registering as a creepy obsession haunting the ear. Ms. Snider skillfully draws a wide arc, with throbbing brass accents and slashing chords driving up tension. The work ends quietly, as if on a question." 3  Colin Roshak of Cleveland Classical similarly described the piece as a "colorful  sort of concerto for orchestra." He added, "Each section enjoyed its moment to shine as the piece cycled through a series of themes and rhythmic variations. It begins with an ethereal high note played by a single violin, and expands into a Mahlerian world of sound and textures." 4
