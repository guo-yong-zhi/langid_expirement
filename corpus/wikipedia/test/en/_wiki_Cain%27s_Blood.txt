"Cain's Blood" is a song written and originally recorded by American country music artist Michael Johnson. He co-wrote the song with Jack Sundrud and recorded it on his 1995 album Departure. It was recorded the same year by the country vocal group 4 Runner, whose version was released as their debut single from their album 4 Runner. 4 Runner's version of the song reached number 26 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. 1 
The song is about "the tug and pull  that goes on inside each and every one of us", according to Polydor Records then-president Steve Miller. 2  It uses the Biblical story of Cain and Abel to represent the narrator's struggle between good and evil. 3  Co-writer Michael Johnson said that the idea for the chorus came to him while he was in jail for driving under the influence. 4  Johnson himself also recorded the song on his 1995 album Departure. 5 
The music video premiered in February 1995. It was filmed at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 2 
"Cain's Blood" generally received positive reception for its Southern gospel sound. 2  The single was also compared to the sound of The Oak Ridge Boys due to the use of four-part vocal harmony. 6  Brian Wahlert of Country Standard Time wrote that the song is a "dark and moody testament to life's daily battle between good and evil in which the four voices become completely integrated into an eerie, foreboding whole." 7 
"Cain's Blood" debuted at number 74 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of March 18, 1995.
