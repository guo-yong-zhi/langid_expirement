United House Developments is a property development and housebuilding company based in Southampton Street, London. It is active in the construction of social housing, urban regeneration, refurbishment and Public Private Partnerships .
The origin of the company lies with Geoffrey Granter who founded Harp Heating in 1964. Initially, the core business was installing central heating in council housing while the tenants remained in occupation. Harp Heating broadened this service into an internal refurbishment product for the GLC operating from its 100,000 sq ft warehouse adjacent to the head office at Swanley. 1  Michael Rayfield was joint MD and shareholder until his death in 1984.
After Jeffrey Adams joined the company in 1982, becoming its joint owner with Granter, the company changed its name and expanded into housebuilding and housing refurbishment.

Granter retired from the business in 2008 and Steven Halbert joined the board as Chairman. Lloyds Development Capital  invested a minority stake and RBS provided bank loans to fund further expansion in inner city private housebuilding. 5
