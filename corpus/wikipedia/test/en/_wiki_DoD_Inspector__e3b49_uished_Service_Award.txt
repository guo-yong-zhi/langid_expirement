The Department of Defense Inspector General Distinguished Service Award is the highest civilian award given by the United States Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General. This award and accompanying Distinguished Service Medal is the DOD OIG's highest award granted to those who distinguished themselves by exceptional service or contributions of the broadest scope to the OIG or DoD.  The achievements or service must be truly exceptional when measured against the position requirements of the individual and should far exceed the contributions and service of others with comparable responsibilities.

a. Exceptional devotion to duty and clearly significant contributions of a broad scope to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement in the operations of the OIG or the Department. 
b. Accomplishments that show unusual management abilities, innovative thinking, and/or outstanding leadership that benefit the OIG. 
c. Accomplishments resulting in major cost savings/reductions/avoidance. 
d. Courage and voluntary risk of personal safety in the face of danger in the performance of assigned duties that benefited the Government or its personnel. 
e. Other exemplary service or contribution.
