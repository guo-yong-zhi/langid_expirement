Schneider completed 29 Palms, CA in 2014. A feature film, art piece that explores the dreams and fantasies of a group of people who live in a trailer community in the Californian desert. The project includes six films: "Hitchhiker", "Rene's dream", "Sidewinder", "Till death do us part", "Heather's dream" and the feature film "The Girl Behind the White Picket Fence". A defining feature is the use of still Polaroid images in succession and voice over. Characters talk to themselves about their ambitions, memories, hopes and dreams. The latest of these short film is "Heather's dream", starring Heather Megan Christie and Udo Kier.
In a review of her book Stranger Than Paradise, Daniel Kothenschulte writes in the German magazine Literaturen that Schneider ". . . takes analog photographs and makes experimental movies with them.  Even if most images remain connected to the genre of road movies in one case one seems to get a glimpse of Ridley Scott's tragic runaways Thelma and Louise." 1 
Schneider has made covers for the Red Hot Chili Peppers single "Desecration Smile"  and Cyndi Lauper's Bring Ya to the Brink album . She produced all the artwork in the 2005 film Stay directed by Marc Forster, for the character played by Ryan Gosling. The film's end credits were also made using expired Polaroid film.
