Agyrium is a genus of saprophytic fungi in the family Agyriaceae.  It probably evolved from a lichen ancestor, as it is closely related to many lichenized species of fungi. 2 
Agyrium was first proposed by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, 3  although the name was not published validly as a type species was not indicated; 4  Fries published the name validly a year later in the second volume of the same work. 5  The species Agyrium rufum was assigned as the type by Frederic Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear in 1931. 6 
Characteristics of genus Agyrium include the following: a poorly developed thallus that is immersed in its substrate; ascomata in the form of an apothecium with a reduced ring-shaped exciple ; paraphyses that are highly branched; and ascospores that are ellipsoid and thin-walled. 7 
The mycelia of Agyrium fungi, although not strictly lichenised, are associated with and sometimes penetrate green algae â€“ particularly near the apothecia. 7  This is a condition that has been described as "facultative parasitism". 8 
As of May 2021 update , Species Fungorum accepts two species of Agyrium. 
The type species, Agyrium rufum, has a largely Northern Hemisphere distribution and occurs widely in Europe, although it has also been recorded in Tasmania. 7  Agyrium aurantium occurs in China. 9 
Although 46 taxa have been placed in Agyrium since its inception, many of them were described more than a century ago and have not been investigated with modern molecular techniques. Several of them have since been transferred to other genera. For example:
