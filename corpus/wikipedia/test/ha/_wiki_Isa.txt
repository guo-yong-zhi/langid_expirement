These units were later moved and arranged by authors and editors. ... Some material has been revised and some created by early Christians." 9  Jesus was a Galilean Jew 10  who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally 11  and often being referred to as "rabbi". 12  Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. 13  14  He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, 15  turned over to the Roman government, and was subsequently crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. 16  After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.
Koyarwar kirista ta tabbatar da imani da yarda da haihuwar Isah sanadiyar ruhine da aka cusa a cikin Mahaifiyarsa ta hannun Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, yana nuna miracles, yasamar da coci, yarasu sanadiyar gicciye shi da akayi, a matsayin sadaukar dashi dan cimma atonement, yatashi bayan yamutu, sannan ascended zuwa Heaven, daga nan ne will return. yawancin Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead 17  either before or after their bodily resurrection, 18  19  20  an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. 21  The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.
Jesus also figures in non-Christian religions and new religious movements. In Islam, Jesus |Isa])) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah. 22  23  24  Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin, but was not the Son of God. The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity. 25  Most Muslims do not believe that he was crucified, but believe that he was physically raised into Heaven by God. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill Messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected. 26
