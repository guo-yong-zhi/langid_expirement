"Let Me Down Gently" was written by Elly Jackson, Ben Langmaid and Ian Sherwin, and produced by Sherwin and Jackson. It is a synth-pop ballad, 1  opening with a "steady electronic beat", 2  which builds up towards a brief moment of silence, followed by a "euphoric, cathartic barnstormer, complete with skyscraping sax solo" at the end of the track. 3  Billboard noted that "the track expertly raises in intensity until abruptly shutting off". 4  The song's lyrics tell about a relationship breakup, and Jackson delivers them in vocals described as "pained and aloof". 5
