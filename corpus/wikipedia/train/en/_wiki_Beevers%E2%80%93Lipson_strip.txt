Beeversâ€“Lipson strips were a computational aid for early crystallographers in calculating Fourier transforms to determine the structure of crystals from crystallographic data, 2  enabling the creation of models for complex molecules. 3  They were used from the 1930s 1  until computers with enough power became generally available in the 1960s.
The technique was developed by C. Arnold Beevers , 4  reader in crystallography at the University of Edinburgh, and Henry Lipson CBE FRS , Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. The approach converted the sizable calculations of multi-dimensional Fourier summations needed in crystallography analysis into sums of more manageable one-dimensional values. 3  The folded card strips with numbers were typically stored in two wooden boxes, 5  one for sines 1  and one for cosines. Previously it was necessary to consult sine/cosine tables, a time-consuming process. The approach was used by the Nobel Prize winner Dorothy Hodgkin OM FRS . 1  6  The technique is still used in modern computer programs. 7
