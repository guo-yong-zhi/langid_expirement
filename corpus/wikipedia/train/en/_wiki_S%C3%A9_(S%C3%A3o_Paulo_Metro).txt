Sé is a central station on Line 1  and Line 3  of the São Paulo Metro. 2  It is located under the Praça da Sé, next to the São Paulo Cathedral. It was officially inaugurated on 17 February 1978.
Praça da Sé has always been present since the first subway projects in São Paulo, either with a station around it or under the square. From 1945 on, with the implementation of the first bus terminal in the city, Praça da Sé was consolidating itself as a nerve center for transport in the capital, with huge queues of passengers for the few buses going to all corners of the city. The construction of the Wilson Mendes Caldeira Building in its surroundings symbolized the frenetic growth of the city of São Paulo, which at that time received the nickname “the fastest growing city in the world”. As a result, São Paulo's transport systems gradually collapsed, putting pressure on the authorities to solve the transport problem.
After several failed attempts, in 1966 the Grupo Executivo do Metropolitano  was formed, and on March 24, 1968 the Companhia do Metropolitano de São Paulo  was founded, which hired a consortium formed by the German construction companies Hochtief and Deconsult and by Montreal, forming the HMD Consortium. 
This underground station has two levels: one for the boarding of Line 1–Blue, and one for the boarding of Line 3–Red. It also consists of a distribution mezzanine and two overlapping levels with two lateral platforms and a central one  with an exposed concrete structure and openings for natural lighting. The main access is integrated with the square at the promenade level. It has capacity for 100,000 passengers at peak hours, and has 39,925 square metres  of built area.
