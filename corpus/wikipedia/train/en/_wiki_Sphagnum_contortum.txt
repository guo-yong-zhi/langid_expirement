Sphagnum contortum is a species of moss 1  reported in North America and Europe. NatureServe marked its global conservation status as Secure. 2 
In English, it goes by the common names contorted sphagnum, twisted sphagnum moss, 2  and twisted bog-moss. 3 
The species is dioicious 4   84â€“85  and sporophyte is rare in this species. S. contortum also has capsules 5  but it is unknown if S. contortum in Great Britain or Ireland have this. 3  4   84 
It occurs in minerotrophic habitats, riparian areas, 6   125  peatlands, 5  and rarely in open wet woodlands. 3  It also occurs at moderate to slow elevations 5  and is not shade tolerant. 6   125 
Sphagnum contortum is frequent in northern and western parts of the British Isles but rare in southern and eastern parts. 4   84 
It also occurs in various parts of the United States. 2  Like in California, it occurs in the north-western parts of the state even in the Klamath Mountains. 7  NatureServe lists it as critically imperiled in States like Washington, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and Montana 2  . 8 
In Canada, S. contortum is widely spread out through the province of Quebec 6   125  where it is listed as apparently secure by NatureServe. But it is listed as vulnerable in other provinces like Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. 2  
It also occurs in other countries like Bulgaria 9  or Turkey, 10  and the Czech Republic. 11   291 
In a study of the effect of the herbicide Asulam on moss growth, Sphagnum contortum was shown to be the second most sensitive to the herbicide out of the 18 species tested. The study concluded that it was sensitive to Asulam exposure. 12
