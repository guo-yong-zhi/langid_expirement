The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the interleukin 1 receptor family. An experiment with transient gene expression demonstrated that this receptor was incapable of binding to interleukin 1 alpha and interleukin 1 beta with high affinity. This gene and four other interleukin 1 receptor family genes, including interleukin 1 receptor, type I , interleukin 1 receptor, type II , interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 , and interleukin 18 receptor 1 , form a cytokine receptor gene cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 2q12. 8
