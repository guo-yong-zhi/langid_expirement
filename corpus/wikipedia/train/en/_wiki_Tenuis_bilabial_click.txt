The voiceless or more precisely tenuis bilabial click is a click consonant found in some languages of southern Africa. 
The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet for a tenuis bilabial click with a velar rear articulation is  kÕ° ò  or  kÕú ò , commonly abbreviated to  k ò ,  ·µè ò  or just   ò . For a click with a uvular rear articulation, the equivalents are  qÕ° ò, qÕú ò, q ò, êû• ò .
Sometimes the accompanying letter comes after the click letter, e.g.   òk  or   ò·µè ; this may be a simple orthographic choice, or it may imply a difference in the relative timing of the releases. 1
