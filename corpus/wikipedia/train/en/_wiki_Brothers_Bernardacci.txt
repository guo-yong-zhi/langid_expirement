The Brothers Bernardacci, Johann Karlovich  and Joseph Karlovich , natives of Lugano , were architects who arrived in Russia in 1822. They created that "—Ålean new town" , which Lermontov found in 1837 at Gorjachevodsk .
Having devoted all of their life to construction on the Caucasus , the Bernardacci created some landmarks connected with the name of Lermontov. In Pyatigorsk they designed Restoratsija, Nikolay's  baths, Diana's grotto, the Aeolian harp pavilion, a gallery above Elisabeth's  spring, the house for retired officers , house of E.A.Hastatova , Areshev's houses , a garden opposite the Nikolay baths , the State garden  and others, and also a direct road from Pyatigorsk to Zheleznovodsk on which Lermontov travelled before his duel. In Kislovodsk the Bernardacci constructed Restoratsija  and A.F. Rebrov's house.
