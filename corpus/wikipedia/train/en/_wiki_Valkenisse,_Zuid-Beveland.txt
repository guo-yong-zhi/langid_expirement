Valkenisse is a former village in the Dutch province of Zeeland.
The village was repeatedly flooded in the 16th and 17th century, and was finally abandoned after the flood of 26 January 1682. 1 
The small remaining part of the domain of Valkenisse was a separate municipality until 1816, when it was merged with Waarde. 2 
The sandbanks in the Westerschelde south of Krabbendijke, the Platen van Valkenisse, are named after the village.
