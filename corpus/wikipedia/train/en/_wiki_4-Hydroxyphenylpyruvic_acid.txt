4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid  is an intermediate in the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine.  The aromatic side chain of phenylalanine is hydroxylated by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to form tyrosine.  The conversion from tyrosine to 4-HPPA is in turn catalyzed by tyrosine aminotransferase. 1   Additionally, 4-HPPA can be converted to homogentisic acid which is one of the precursors to ochronotic pigment. 2 
It is an intermediary compound in the biosynthesis of scytonemin.
