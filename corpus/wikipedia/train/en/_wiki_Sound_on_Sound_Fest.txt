Sound on Sound Fest  was a three-day music, comedy, action sports and camping festival held 35 miles east of downtown Austin, Texas, at the Sherwood Forest Faire, home to an annual renaissance fair, and medieval-style village, set on 23 acres and located in the heart of the Lost Pines Forest region of Central Texas. 
SOS Fest celebrated its inaugural year November 4–6, 2016 with notable performers such as Beach House, Phantogram, Young Thug, Courtney Barnett, Death Grips, Tim Heidecker and more. 1 
Founded by Austin-based promotions company Margin Walker Presents 2  and produced by Funhouse Services and Sound on Sound Event Services, SOS Fest was home to three music stages showcasing emerging and established talent from the worlds of indie, punk, hip hop, metal, and dance music, as well as comedy. 
Created by Graham Williams and much of the same team behind the long-running Fun Fun Fun Fest, 2  SOS Fest aimed to bring the same Austin-centric culture to the forest by including many local businesses, food trucks, restaurants and nonprofits as official vendors of the fest.
With a fan focus, SOS took the festival beyond the music with a comedy and live-panel discussion stage, a skateboard and BMX halfpipe, a wrestling ring, a disco dungeon, and 15 acres of camping. The festival also incorporated the renaissance theme of Sherwood Forest Faire into the daily fest activities with period actors roaming the grounds, jousting, turkey legs, and SOS Fest's own fire-breathing dragon that lives at the top of the main stage.
SOS Fest was scheduled to return for its second year on November 10–12, 2017 at Sherwood Forest, but was canceled by organizers on October 6.
