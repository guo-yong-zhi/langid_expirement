Spitfire Over Berlin is a 2022 British war film focusing on an aerial spying mission during World War II. Like Burn's prior film, Lancaster Skies, it is a homage to the British war films of the 1940s and 1950s, and is inspired by true events.
Daredevil pilot Edward Barnes is recruited for a special mission: Operation Extreme Jeopardy, taking an unarmed observation plane over Berlin to photograph defence installations and prevent an American squadron from heading to certain death. 3 
The film was inspired by the RAF Photo Reconnaissance Unit, who provided photographic intelligence for the Allied Forces during World War II. The film was shot in Lincolnshire. 4 
Phil Hoard of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, writing,  Spitfire Over Berlinâ€™s ambition is laudable, and the flight sequences are precise and technically accomplished for a DIY production. But it needs to take a good hard look under the hood.' 5  The Times also gave it two out of five stars, commending the Burns' efforts with limited resources, but stating, 'The results, alas, in actual film-making terms, are punishingly poor and amount to little more than 80 minutes of bad acting inside a cardboard cockpit'. 6
