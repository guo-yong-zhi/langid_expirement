Tmesiphantes crassifemur is a species of theraphosine theraphosid spider. It is native to Argentina. 1 
In 1960, Berta Gerschman de Pikelin and Rita Schiapelli described this species as Melloleitaoina crassifemur. In 1993, Gunter Schmidt transferred the species to Dryptopelma, but this was rejected by Fernando PÃ©rez-Miles in 1996. In 2019, the species was transferred to Tmesiphantes. 1 
Tmesiphantes crassifemur is only known from the male. It is characterized by a very curved embolus without any triangular tooth. The prolateral inferior embolar keel is just as long as the prolateral superior and the apex of the embolus is widened. 2
