Holmes County State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Mississippi located off U.S. Route 51 approximately 4 miles  south of Durant. The park features two lakes, 45-acre  English Lake and 14-acre  Odum Lake. 3 
Development of Holmes County State Park was begun in 1935 by the CCC, which constructed Mississippi's first nine state parks. 4  The park is significant for its 1930s rustic style architecture, with buildings designed to integrate with the natural landscape. 2  The construction of this and other state parks in Mississippi have been deemed an "excellent example of cooperative efforts between the state and federal government to help reduce the unemployment rates during the Great Depression." 4 
The park offers 28 campsites built around two fishing lakes, a picnic area and shelters, and boat launch. 3
