Melitaea acentria is a butterfly was discovered in 2017 1  by evolutionary biologist-entomologist Vladimir Lukhtanov 2  over Mount Hermon ski resort, northern Israel. 3  When it was first seen in 2012 it was incorrectly believed that it belonged to the Persian fritillary  species 4  due to its similar appearance.  Once the internal anatomy and DNA was researched, this was discounted as it had the Acentria's fritillary DNA, different genitalia and a unique molecular signature. It is more than 1.5 million years old and is Israelâ€™s first newly-discovered butterfly species in over a century. 5  Its natural habitat is northern Israel, Syria and Lebanon. 6  It is among a very few butterflies that has resulted from hybridisation between two other species in the past. 7
