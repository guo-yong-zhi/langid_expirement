Most properties north of Heron are managed by Timbercreek Asset Management 15  who took possession in 2012. In 2016, Timbercreek evicted residents from 80 townhomes in Heron Gate, to make room for new developments in the area. 15   In May 2018, it announced that it would evict residents of a further 150 townhomes, due to structural problems with the buildings. 16   The decision to redevelop the area received criticism from residents and interested parties such as the UN special rapporteur on Adequate Housing, 17  and was described as the "'largest forced displacement in Canada' in recent history." 18 
These evictions were criticized as being part of a broader pattern of racist “reno-victions” or “demo-victions”, 19  as “90% of more than 500 tenants evicted in 2018 after rental properties were allowed to deteriorate were racial minorities”. 20  Nonetheless, Heron Gate has been noted by scholars such as Emily Power, Bjarke Skærlund Risager, 21  and  Marina Gomá as an important site of working class, anti-racist activism by its residents. As Gomá notes, 
“The Herongate Tenant Coalition articulates a different reality to the narrative of Canadian benevolence, embodying class solidarity, denouncing structural racism, and recruiting allies to donate to their legal case against Timbercreek Management.” 22 
Following an extended grassroots activist campaign and a human rights challenge, 23  Timbercreek agreed to provide CAD$2,000 in moving compensation, relocation assistance and negotiated discounts with Ottawa moving companies. 24
