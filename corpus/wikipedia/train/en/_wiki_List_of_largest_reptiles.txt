This list of largest reptiles takes into consideration both body length and mass of large reptile species, including average ranges and maximum records. The league comprises predominantly living crocodilians reaching a length of 4 m  and a mass of 500 kg  or more. It is worth mentioning that unlike the upper weight of mammals, birds or fish, mass in reptiles is frequently poorly documented, thus subject to conjecture and estimation. 1 
The saltwater crocodile is considered to be the largest extant reptile, verified at up to 6.32 m  in length and around 1,000–1,500 kg  in mass. 2  Larger specimens have been reported albeit not fully verified, 3  the maximum of which is purportedly 7 m  long with an estimated mass of 2,000 kg . 1 
The following table below lists the 15 largest extant reptile species ranked according to their average mass range, with maximum reported/reliable/estimated mass also being provided.
 
The larger of the two extant species of the New Zealand native tuataras is the Brothers Island tuatara . The maximum size is 1.4 kg  and 76 cm .
Some of these marine reptiles were comparable in size to modern cetaceans. The largest ichthyosaur was the Late Triassic species Shastasaurus sikanniensis, at approximately 21 m  long 86  87  and 81.5 t  in weight. 88  This massive animal, from the Norian stage in what is now British Columbia, is considered the largest marine reptile so far found in the fossil record. 89  However, in 2018, a specimen from Lilstock was discovered to be 25 percent larger, approximately 26 m  in length, making it the largest marine reptile to have ever lived, 90  with some believing to even dethrone the blue whale in size. 91  92  Shonisaurus popularis is another enormous ichthyosaur. It reached 15 m  in length and 29.7 t  in weight. 87  Cymbospondylus youngorum is the largest Middle Triassic ichthyosaur, with 14 to 17.65 m  in length 93  88  and 14.7 to 135.8 t  in weight. 88 
A terrestrial relative of turtles survived until about 2,000 years ago, the Australasian Meiolania at about 2.6 m  long and a weight of over 1 t . 1  Later research suggests the maximum length possibly over 3 m . 113 
Plesiosaurs were aquatic reptiles of the Mesozoic era. They had a broad flat body, a short tail, and strong flippers. Most of the Plesiosauroidea group are identified by their long necks, while Pliosauroidea are usually short-necked. The largest known plesiosauroid is Aristonectes, with a body length of 10–11.86 metres  and body mass of 4 t  114  or even 10.7–13.5 t . 115  The largest well known pliosauroid is Pliosaurus funkei at 10–13 m  in length. 116 
A Mesozoic reptile is believed to have been the largest flying animal that ever existed: the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus northropi, from North America during the late Cretaceous. This species is believed to have weighed up to 126 kg , measured 7.9 m  in total length ) and measured up to 10–12 m  across the wings. 137  138  Another possible contender for the largest pterosaur is Hatzegopteryx, which is estimated to have had an 11–12 m  wingspan. 138  137  An unnamed Mongolian pterodactyloid pterosaur 139  and Arambourgiania from Jordan could reach a wingspan of nearly 10 m . 140
