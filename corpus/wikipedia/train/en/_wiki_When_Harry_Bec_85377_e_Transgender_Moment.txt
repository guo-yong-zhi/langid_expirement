When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment is a book critical of modern transgender rights and certain treatments for gender dysphoria, written by the socially conservative political philosopher Ryan T. Anderson and published by Encounter Books in 2018. 1  The book focuses on the cultural and political debates surrounding transgender identity, with a particular focus on criticizing what the author describes as "transgender ideology". 2  3 
When Harry Became Sally was criticized for repeatedly using the birth or other former name  of trans people, and accused of ignoring the realities that trans people face. 1  4  On the other hand, it has received praise, notably from conservative media. 5  2 
In February 2021 the book was the first removed from Amazon.com's store under a new hate speech policy enacted by the company. 6  7  The move was criticized by the National Coalition Against Censorship, 8  9  and United States Senator Tom Cotton. 8  On March 12, in response to a letter from four other senators, Amazon clarified that the company has "chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness." 10  11  Anderson denies that his book describes transgender persons as "mentally ill". 10
