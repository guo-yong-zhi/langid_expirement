Murrah Federal Building. 17  NASA hired Exponent in 1986 to determine the causes of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
In 2003, Exponent was hired by the U.S. government to investigate the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. 18  In 2017, Samsung hired Exponent to determine cause of thermal runaway of the Note 7 Phone batteries. 19

The quality and neutrality of reports produced by the company have been called into question on various controversial topics. citation needed  Common points of critique include corporate denialism and that, for industrial clients, only favorable reports are seemingly produced. Examples include Exponent arguing in 2001 that dioxins do not cause cancer. 21   These questions of conflict of interest have been disputed. citation needed  The type of work that Exponent performs is contractually highly confidential—until their clients decide otherwise. Thus, while Exponent may issue reports that are both favorable and unfavorable to its clients, Exponent's clients have the option of releasing only the favorable reports, creating the appearance of bias.
According to the Los Angeles Times, "Exponent's research has come under fire from critics, including engineers, attorneys and academics who say the company tends to deliver to clients the reports they need to mount a public defense." 17  Exponent's executive chairman responded that such criticism is a "cheap shot", responding "Do we tell our clients a lot of what they don't want to hear? Absolutely." but that they also often come up with results not favoring their clients. 17  No concrete examples were however provided for the paper. In 2009, the Amazon Defense Coalition criticized an Exponent study commissioned by the energy company Chevron that dumping oil waste didn't cause cancer because Chevron's largest shareholder was a director on Exponent's board. The firm was also criticized for assisting industry efforts to reduce chromium regulation. 22
