14-Methoxydihydromorphinone is a semi-synthetic opioid related to 14-methoxymetopon , an opioid with a Ki of 0.15 nM, and 14-O-methyloxymorphone  with a Ki of 0.10 nM. By contrast, oxymorphone has a Ki of 0.97 nM and morphine one of 6.55 nM . This suggests that both 14-OMO and 14-MM have a higher mu/kappa selectivity than oxymorphone. 1  2
