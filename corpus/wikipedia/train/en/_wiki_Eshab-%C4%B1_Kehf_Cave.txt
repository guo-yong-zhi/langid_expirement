Eshab-ı Kehf Cave, also known as Ashab-ı Kehf Cave or Seven Sleepers' Cave,  is a show cave situated to the north of Tarsus, an ilçe  in Mersin Province, Turkey. The cave is named after the Persian word اصحاب کهف  itself from the Arabic "aṣḥāb al kahf", "people of the cave", for Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, a belief in Christian and Islamic tradition.
The cave is about 14 kilometres  to Tarsus and about 40 kilometres  to Mersin. It is at the foothill of a small hill. The cave is small, not comparable to other caves of the province. However, it is a famed to be the cave of the Seven Sleepers. The exact location of the Seven Sleepers' cave is not known, and there are many other places including some in Turkey claiming to be the cave of the Seven Sleepers. 1  Next to the cave, there is a mosque commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Abdülaziz , and built in 1873. The mosque's tall minaret with three şerefes  were added later. 2
