Poodytes is a genus of passerine birds in the grassbird family Locustellidae.
A molecular phylogenetic study of the grassbird family Locustellidae published in 2018 found that some of the genera, as then defined, were non-monophyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, five species were moved from Megalurus to the resurrected genus Poodytes. 1  2  The genus had been introduced in 1851 by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis to accommodate the little grassbird which is therefore the type species. 3  4  The genus name combines the Ancient Greek poa meaning "grass" with dutÄ“s meaning "diver". 5 
The genus contains the following species: 2
