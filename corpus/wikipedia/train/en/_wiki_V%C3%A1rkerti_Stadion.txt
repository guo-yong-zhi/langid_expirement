Várkert Stadium is a football stadium in Kisvárda, Hungary. The UEFA category 3 arena is home to the association football side Kisvárda FC. The stadium has a capacity of 2,850. 2 
The stadium was planned to be built for HUF 120 million in 2014, however step by step it managed to cost taxpayers a lot more. After categorised as an economically significant investment, another HUF 800 million was awarded in 2014, which grew to 1.5 billion and then 2 billion in a short time. In the end a further 473 million HUF was spent on building a heat pipe system from the nearby thermal water complex - making the total investment HUF 2.5 billion - basically 1 million for each spectator seat.  A typical example how one politician's dream can make others pay for it.
