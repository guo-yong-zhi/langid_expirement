Rebecca Hart  is a para-equestrian from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hart was born with a rare genetic disease, Familial spastic paraplegia . FSP affected Hart as a child with difficulty gaining strength in her upper body as well as slowing down her motor development.
At the age of 10, Rebecca began horseback riding. Just a few years later after attending the Paralympic movement in 1998 at a regional competition in Atlanta, Georgia, Hart realized that she would like to train for competition. That same year, 1998, Hart purchased her first horse.
Hart has been the United States Equestrian Federation  National Para-Equestrian Champion six times; 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Hart made her first appearance at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008, competing with her horse Norteassa. She would go on to claim 4th place in freestyle at her first games.
She would go on to compete with Norteassa at the World Equestrian Games  in Lexington, KY, which would be her last competition with Norteassa. After Norteassa's retirement, she went on to ride Missy Ransehousen's Lord Ludger for the 2012 season. The 2012 season was a very successful one for Rebecca and ‘LoLu’, winning the Wellington Sunshine Classic CPEDI3* along with the 2012 National Para-Equestrian Championships. Winning these competitions is what named Rebecca and LoLu as members of the 2012 United States Paralympic Team, as well as naming Rebecca Team Captain. Rebecca went on to score the highest among all other U.S. team members at the 2012 London Paralympics.
Schroeter's Romani was purchased for Rebecca at the end of 2014. Together they were named the National Champions in 2014, along with being named to the 2014 World Equestrian Games in Normandy, France. Soon after Rebecca won the 2015 Global/Adequan CPEDI3* in Florida. 1
