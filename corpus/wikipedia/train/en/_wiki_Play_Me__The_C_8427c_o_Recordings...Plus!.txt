The Plus! part of the collection contains live tracks from:
In addition to all of the album and bonus tracks, Play Me contains the CD debuts of Broad Old Woman  , and the live single version of "Cherry Cherry" from Hot August Night. It also contains the re-recorded version of Shilo, which was added to Velvet Gloves and Spit after its initial release, as well as the hit single Sweet Caroline, which started as a non-album single, but was later added to the album Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show, which was then reissued as Sweet Caroline.
While this album can be said to contain every track from the studio albums, it does not contain every note. For whatever reason, Shilo is missing the opening note, while Stones is missing a couple of measures from the intro. 2
