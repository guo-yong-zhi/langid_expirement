The marovany  is a suitcase shaped, wooden, type of box zither from Madagascar, used in Malagasy music. 2  It is strung on both sides with metal strings. The player plucks the strings with both hands, often with rapid alternation. This often creates complex rhythmic patterns, typical of Malagasy music. 3   It is tuned in sequences of thirds. The instrument is commonly used in rituals and spiritual gatherings. 4 
The marovany and other instruments are used by Madagascar musical troupes at reburial ceremonies, where the music is believed to help a medium better enter a trance state during rituals which will only be successful if the correct type of music is being played. 5
