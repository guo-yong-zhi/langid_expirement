The station signed on in 1970 as WHYP-FM. Owned by James D. Brownyard, it was a simulcast of then sister station WHYP  1530's Country Music format. 1  WHYP and WHYP-FM were sold to Rambaldo Communications in 1989. On June 22, 1989 at 12:00 p.m., WHYP-FM became WRKT as Rocket 101 at 100.9 MHz, for 28 years before moving up the dial to 104.9 MHz and rebranding as Rocket 105 at 12:00 p.m. on October 20, 2017. The final song as "Rocket 101" was "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, while the first song as "Rocket 105" was "For Those About to Rock " by AC/DC. 2  The 100.9 frequency was to be reallocated to Westfield, New York, and sold at auction. Rick Rambaldo, owner of WEHP, won the bid, but was late in getting his down payment sent to the FCC, leading to rejection of his bid. The frequency again went up for auction in April 2020 . Rambaldo held an agreement to restore the oldies format that had previously been on WZTE until 2017 had he won the auction. 3  Rambaldo sold WEHP in 2019, but re-entered the 2021 auction, winning the bidding for the 100.9 license. 4  In 2022, Family Life Network claimed that it had acquired the frequency and relocated the 100.9 allocation back to North East as WCGE. 5
