Ashes Remain is from Baltimore, Maryland, 1  where Josh Smith of Florida 1  and Ryan Nalepa met at River Valley Ranch, a summer youth camp during worship services. 2   They prayed about forming a band, which they did when the opportunity arose for Smith to become worship leader at a church. 2  This church was just minutes from Nalepa's home, so this facilitated the band's creation. 2  The other members of the band, which comprised Rob Tahan, Jonathan Hively and Ben Kirk, were not added until some years later. 2  In the summer of 2003, Ashes Remain released their first independent record, Lose the Alibis. According to the band, the album moved around 2,000 copies in one year. 3 
On August 2, 2003, the band announced on their official website that they competed and won the "Philadelphia Regional Christian Artist Talent Search 2003". Later on, they went to Charlotte, NC for the next round of competition on September 24, 2003.

On September 4, 2004, bass guitar player Ben Ogden left the group, and hand-picked Jon Hively as the band's new bassist before leaving. Lose the Alibis was followed by Last Day Breathing on March 13, 2007 and the Red Devotion EP on July 22, 2009. In early 2010, Ashes Remain signed with Fair Trade Services. Ashes Remain has been together for ten years as of 2011. 1  Their album What I've Become was made "from the perspective of feeling like there's no hope but finding out that there really is." 2  The band feels that the "journey from dark to light isn't overnight and sometimes has to be traveled many times, but it's a journey the band is familiar with and feels called to travel with its fans." 2   They have widespread appeal and their songs are played on CCM and Christian Rock and Rap stations around the country.  Ashes Remain toured with Fireflight on the Stay Close Tour in early 2012. 4
