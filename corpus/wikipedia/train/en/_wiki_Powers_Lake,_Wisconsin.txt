Originally called Lakeville and then Nippersink, Powers Lake was named after James B. Powers, one of its early settlers, convivial neighbor, and one of our first postmasters. The farming community appreciated our fertile Wisconsin soil and access to a water supply. 5  Recreational activities garnered interest around the lakes in the 1880’s, but it was in the 1890’s that fishermen and others, primarily from Chicago, enjoyed long visits in the area and eventually developed the North Shore of Powers Lake. Ice companies also ‘mined’ the south shores of Powers Lake and the north shore of Benedict Lake in the 1890’s, eventually establishing five ice houses on Powers Lake. 5
