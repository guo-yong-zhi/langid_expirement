Direct Access Archive, or DAA, is a proprietary file format developed by PowerISO Computing for disk image files. The format supports features such as compression, password protection, and splitting to multiple volumes. Popular Windows disk image mounting programs such as Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools currently do not support the mounting of DAA images; Linux and BSD also do not support mounting images of this kind.
Currently there is no published information about the format. Among mainstream applications, it can be opened or converted with MagicISO and UltraISO. Various free and open-source packages are also available to convert DAA to ISO images.
