Green River station is a former train station in Green River, Wyoming. It was served by the Union Pacific Railroad from its construction to 1971, and by Amtrak from 1971 to 1983 and 1991â€“1997. The Pioneer was the last train to serve Green River.
The depot is a contributing property to the Green River Downtown Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.
The Union Pacific Railroad first reached Green River from the east on October 1, 1868, while building the first transcontinental railroad. The company later opened a depot in the town. 1   However, the old depot was starting to show its age and Green River residents say that "the town is dying" and that a new depot had to be built.  There were fears that Green River would be abandoned in favor of Granger, a town to the west of Green River and a junction on the Overland Route.  But construction of a new depot has begun, and in 1910 the current depot was completed, as well as offices being moved into the depot from Ogden. After the depot was constructed, Green River grew into a major town on the line and was a division point for the railroad.  Sometime in the 1940s the crow's nest lookout on the trackside roof was added. 2 
Amtrak took over intercity service on May 1, 1971, with its City of San Francisco running until June 1972, when it was replaced by the San Francisco Zephyr. The California Zephyr replaced the San Francisco Zephyr on a more southern route on July 16, 1983, ending passenger rail service to Green River.
Amtrak service was restored with the rerouting of the Pioneer via Green River on June 17, 1991. Amtrak service ended for a second time on May 10, 1997, when the Pioneer was discontinued. 3 
The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 8, 2009, as a contributing property to the Green River Downtown Historic District. 4  5 
Currently, the depot is undergoing restoration by the city itself and has received around $200,000 by the EPA to clean up contaminants in the depot.  After the cleaning, restoration of the roof will begin. 6
