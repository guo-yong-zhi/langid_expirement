The tenth season was initially to be the final one on Fox; however, on July 20, 2014, it was announced that Fox had three unaired episodes left for broadcast. Reports from Fox seemed to imply that these three episodes constituted a season of their own. Among multiple discrepant reports from TBS, one indicated that the three episodes were the beginning of the 11th season to resume on their network. 4  
The DVD release and Hulu count this season as the first three episodes of season 12.
