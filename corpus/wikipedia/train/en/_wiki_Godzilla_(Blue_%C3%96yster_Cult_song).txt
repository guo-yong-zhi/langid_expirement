"Godzilla" is a single by U.S. hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult, the first track on the band's fifth studio album Spectres. The lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the popular movie monster of the same name. The single release had a picture sleeve featuring a promotional still from the movie Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. 4  Despite failing to chart, the song received significant airplay on rock radio stations 5  and became a sleeper hit. The song, along with " The Reaper" and "Burnin' for You," is one of the band's best-known songs and has become a staple of its live performances. It has been covered by bands such as moe., Racer X, Fu Manchu, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sebastian Bach, Double Experience and Fighting Gravity. 6 
Cash Box called it "a clever rocker tale of Godzilla...with a strong, catchy hook, excellent guitar and special effects." 7 
In 2019, a cover of the song, sung by Serj Tankian, was featured in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, marking the first usage of the song in a Godzilla film.
In response to the song's absence from the 1998 Godzilla soundtrack, Blue Öyster Cult members Eric Bloom and Buck Dharma created their own parody called "NoZilla", 8  released only to radio stations.
