Cle Elum Lake is a lake and reservoir along the course of the Cle Elum River, in Washington state USA. At the site of the future city of Cle Elum, Washington, a Northern Pacific Railway station was named Clealum after the Kittitas name Tle-el-Lum , meaning "swift water", referring to the Cle Elum River. The lake was also labeled as Kleattam Lake in maps of the 1850s. 1 
Cle Elum Lake is the easternmost lake of three large lakes  in the Cascade Range. The middle one, Kachess Lake is also north of I-90 while the westernmost, Keechelus Lake is south of I-90.
Cle Elum Lake is part of the Columbia River basin, as the Cle Elum River is a tributary of the Yakima River, which is a tributary to the Columbia River.
The lake is used as a storage reservoir for the Yakima Project, an irrigation project run by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Although a natural lake, Cle Elum Lake's capacity and discharge is controlled by Cle Elum Dam, a 165-foot  high earthfill structure built in 1933. As a storage reservoir, Cle Elum Lake's active capacity is 436,900 acre feet . 2
