Additional Housing Grant  is an additional subsidy over and above the regular market subsidy and Central Provident Fund Housing Grant that new and resale HDB  flat buyers in Singapore can enjoy.  It offsets the purchase price of a new or resale HDB flat in Singapore, thereby reducing the housing loan a flat buyer needs to take.
The AHG was first introduced on 3 Mar 2006 to help lower-income citizen families buy their first HDB flat.  Under the AHG, households earning below the monthly income ceiling can qualify for an additional subsidy .  The AHG has since undergone two enhancements.  The first was in Aug 2007, and the second enhancement was on 6 Feb 2009. 1 
The latest increase in income ceiling from S$4,000 to S$5,000 increases the coverage of the AHG from 50 to 60 percent of resident households.  In addition, the condition of continuous employment preceding the flat application is reduced from two years to one year.
The enhanced AHG is applicable to the purchase of flats as follows: 
The AHG will only be given once to each eligible family.  As with the current scheme, the enhanced grant is given to Singapore Citizen only , and can only be used as capital payment for the flat purchase.  The balance, if any, must be used to reduce the mortgage loan before a housing loan from HDB can be granted.

The applicant must form a family comprising the applicant and his/her:
