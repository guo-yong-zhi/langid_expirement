Cornelis Ruhtenberg  1  was an Latvian-American painter.
Ruhtenberg was born in Riga, Latvia to Hanne Helmsing Ruhtenberg, and Jan Ruhtenberg. 2  3  4  She and her two brothers grew up in Latvia, Germany, and Sweden, with the family moving to Berlin in the late 1920s after Jan received a scholarship to Berliner Technische Hochschule. 3  4  In 1931 her parents divorced, and Ruhtenberg chose to stay with her mother in Berlin while her father moved to Sweden to work. 4  She studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Bildende Kunst in Berlin between 1941 and 1946, during which time she lived with her mother. 2  3  In 1942, her senior year of high school, she broke both arms in a gymnastics accident and was thus able to avoid joining Nazi youth labor groups; by the time she had recovered, the government was more focused on the war than bureaucracy, and didn't follow up with her. 3  She maintained a low profile for the remainder of the war, despite being an associate of Karl Hofer and Max Kaus, and was not attacked by the Nazi party. 3  While laying low, she focused on her painting. 3  After the war ended, she would scavenge plywood from demolished buildings to paint on. 3  Around the same time, she was named one of Germany's 25 greatest living painters by the Prolog group, and one of only four women on the list. 3 
She immigrated to the United States in April or May 1948, where she reunited with her father, who had lived in the country since 1932. 1  5  In May of that year, she exhibited 15 paintings at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. 3  Other artists from the center said there was "no explanation for the astonishing talent she has developed under unimaginable conditions". 3 
She lived in and exhibited her art in New York City 6  before moving to Iowa with her husband, Jules Kirschenbaum, whom she had met in 1952 and who taught at Drake University. 5  7  In 1954 one of her paintings was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 8  She exhibited art at the Museum of Modern Art three times: in 1955, 1956, and 1962. 9  In 1957 she illustrated a children's book, Straps the Cat, which was written by Claudia Lewis. 10  11 
Ruhtenberg died in Issaquah, Washington in 2008. 2 
Ruhtenberg primarily painted figures who were "caught in their own contemplative worlds", and who were more loosely and abstracted painted compared to the environments they were set in. 2  5  She favored muted colors in her works, 2  5  and tended to paint fairly flat backgrounds. 12 
Three of Ruhtenberg's works are housed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. 2
