Phyllodes imperialis, the imperial fruit-sucking moth or pink underwing moth, is a noctuoid moth in the family Erebidae, subfamily Calpinae. It was first described by Herbert Druce in 1888. The species can be found in north-eastern Queensland to northern New South Wales, Papua New Guinea, Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia.
The wingspan is 130â€“170 millimetres . The "leaf-shaped" forewings are grey-brown and show a distinctive white or yellow marking which varies somewhat among populations. The ventral side of the forewing has a discal, dark-brown patch containing three white spots. The hindwings are dark brown to black with a large central pink patch extending to the inner margin, to which the common name "pink underwing moth" refers.
Early instars of the caterpillar are dull brown, but green individuals are also observed. Mature caterpillars are dark brown to reddish brown and show large eyespots. These are composed of a black pupil surrounded by a blue, then yellow ring. Between and below the eyespots are white markings, often described as looking like teeth, and resemble the teeth from a cartoon skeleton. 1
