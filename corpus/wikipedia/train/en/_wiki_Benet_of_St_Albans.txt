Benet of St Albans was a medieval English monk and biographer of Thomas Becket.
Benet was a monk at the Benedictine monastery of St Albans Abbey during the abbacy of Simon . About 1184, Benet composed a hagiography of Becket in French verse, basing it partly on the now-lost work of Robert of Cricklade. 1  This set of verses is one of the secondary sources for Becket's life. 2 
The verses have been edited and published by F. Michel in 1844. 1  In turn, Benet's work was used as a source for the 14th-century Icelandic saga about Becket titled Th√≥mas saga erkibyskups. 3
