The 1912â€“13 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program. 
Building upon the recent success of the young program, the Aggies scheduled three games against the upper echelon teams. Mass Ag lost all three games but in their other three matches the Aggies proved they were still among the best of the rest.
