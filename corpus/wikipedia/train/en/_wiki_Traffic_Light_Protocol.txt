The Traffic Light Protocol  is a system for classifying sensitive information created in the early 2000s by the UK Government's National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre, in order to encourage greater sharing of sensitive information. 1 
The fundamental concept is for the originator to signal how widely they want their information to be circulated beyond the immediate recipient. It is designed to improve the flow of information between individuals, organizations or communities in a controlled and trusted way. It is important that everyone who handles TLP-labeled communications understands and obeys the rules of the protocol. Only then can trust be established and the benefits of information sharing realized. The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labeling information with one of four colors to indicate what further dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the originator if wider dissemination is required.
A number of current specifications for TLP exist.

In practice, one will indicate a document's classification with the acronym "TLP", followed by a colon and classification level, for example: "TLP:RED".
