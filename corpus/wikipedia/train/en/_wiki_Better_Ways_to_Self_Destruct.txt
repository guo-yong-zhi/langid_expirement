Better Ways to Self Destruct is the 2001 EP by easyworld, an Eastbourne-based indie rock band. This was the band's second release, after their "Hundredweight" single, and this EP contained that earlier single, a new version of b-side "You Make Me Want To Drink Bleach" and 5 new songs, all recorded in lead singer David Ford's bedroom in his parents' house.
While the EP's recording budget was somewhat limited, the band still managed to build up a small fanbase, touring with King Adora, and undertaking headlining tours of their own. 5 tracks on this EP  were re-recorded for This is Where I Stand, the band's debut album proper, appearing a year later in 2002.
