The men's lightweight  Thai-Boxing division at the W.A.K.O. European Championships 2006 in Skopje was the fourth lightest of the male Thai-Boxing tournaments and involved nine fighters.  Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Thai-Boxing rules.
As there were not enough men for a tournament fit for sixteen, seven of the fighters received a bye into the quarter-finals.  The tournament gold medallist was Pashik Tatoyan from Russia who defeated Bahtiyar Iskanderzade from Azerbaijan in the final via a unanimous decision victory.  Semi finalists Gor Shavelyan from Russia and Aleksandar Jankovic from Serbia received bronze medals for their efforts. 1  2
