Crème anglaise can be poured over cakes or fruits as a sauce or eaten as part of desserts such as floating island. It also serves as a base ingredient for other desserts such as ice cream or crème brûlée.
It is occasionally known as "drinking custard" in the American South and served like eggnog during the Christmas season. 2 
Other names include the French terms crème à l'anglaise  and crème française . 3 
Imitation custard sauce, containing no egg, is often made from instant custard powders such as Bird's Custard.
