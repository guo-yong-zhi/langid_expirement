Coro Province  was a province in the Zulia Department of Gran Colombia, and later one of the provinces of Venezuela, after Venezuelan independence in 1830. In 1864 it became one of the States of Venezuela, as Coro State, and was renamed Falc√≥n State in 1874.
The Province was created in 1811 in royalist opposition to the Venezuelan War of Independence, and recognised by royal decree in 1815. In 1821, with the defeat of royalist forces, it was incorporated into Gran Colombia.
