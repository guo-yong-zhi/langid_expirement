Phigalia denticulata, the toothed phigalia, is a moth of the  family Geometridae. It is found from Ontario and New York to Florida, west to Texas, north to Missouri. There are also records from Utah.
The wingspan is 30â€“37 mm for males. The female wings are reduced to tiny  nubs, making it impossible for them to fly. Adults are on wing from December to April in the south and from late March to April in the north.
The larvae probably feed on the leaves of deciduous trees.
