More wildly improbable situations follow, including Little Legionnaire beating Tiny in a fight, before they are sent to the Russian Front. In their assault guns, Bertha I and Bertha II, they launch an attack on Soviet T-34s. Bertha I, commanded by Wilhelm "Old Man" Beier, successfully knocks out a T-34.

Bertha I is immobilized but still manages to knock out the Soviet SPG. They escape back to German lines on foot, losing only young Pvt. "Freckles" Fredericks.
