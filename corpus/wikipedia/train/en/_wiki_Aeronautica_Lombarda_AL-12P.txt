The Aeronautica Lombarda AL-12P  was a Second World War Italian transport glider built by the Aeronautica Lombarda for the Italian Army. 1 
 The AL-12P was designed by A. Ambrosini and was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a wood-ribbed fuselage covered with stressed molded plywood. 1  Its wing had a foliated spruce plywood spar and was covered with plywood although the ailerons were fabric covered. 1  It also had large slotted spoilers that could be opened perpendicular above and below the wing. 1  The pilot and co-pilot sat side by side in the nose which is made from plywood-covered welded steel tubes and was hinged to allow cargo to be loaded into the fuselage, a passenger door was fitted on the right hand side of the fuselage. 1  It could carry 12 fully equipped troops or the equivalent weight in equipment. 1  The company built 16 AL-12Ps for the Italian Army. 1 
 After World War II, S.A.I.-Ambrosini modified at least one AL-12P to be powered by 2 Ã— 167.78 kW  Alfa Romeo 115ter six-cylinder air-cooled engines and fitted with a revised undercarriage with shock absorber struts attached to the engine nacelles braced by V-struts from the fuselage sides. 2
