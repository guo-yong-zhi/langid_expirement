Sneakin' Around is a collaborative album by American guitarists Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed, released in 1991. Reed and Atkins had done a series of recording collaborations nearly 20 years before this release. It peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard Country Albums charts.
At the Grammy Awards of 1993, Sneakin' Around won the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. Chet was also nominated that year for his work with The Chieftains' "Tahitian Skies".
Allmusic music critic Richard S. Ginell called the album a "most welcome" encore and wrote; "the old Atkins/Reed country ways filter in, the rapport and good humor between the two intact and bubbling..." 1
