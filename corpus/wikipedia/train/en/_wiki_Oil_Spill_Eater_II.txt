Oil Spill Eater II is a biocatalytic system of preformed multi-enzyme liquid concentrate for treating oil spills.  When combined with fresh or salt water and oxygen, it will cause crude oil and other organic substances to rapidly decompose, eventually biodegrading them to carbon dioxide and water. 1 
Oil Spill Eater II is a bioremediation process for the mitigation of hazardous waste, spills and contamination. It uses bioremediation processes that eliminate hazardous materials. 2  It is a biological enzyme that converts the oil spills into a natural food source for the native bacteria found in the environment. The result of this process is the enzyme eater. The enzyme permanently eliminates the hazardous waste problem, with no secondary clean-up required. 2  
Oil spill eater II contains the biosurfactants, nutrients, and other constituents for complete life cycles and biodegradation. When Oil Spill Eater II is added to a spill, the process generally takes several minutes, depending on how heavy the damage is. 3  As the biosurfactants do their job, the enzymes attach themselves to broken down hydrocarbon structures, forming digestive binding sites.
Oil Spill Eater II spreads the oil onto the water's surface, lessening its influence on the subsurface. It starts to prevent secondary contamination of the water column or tertiary contamination on the body of water associated with the spill area. 4 
The system can reduce costs of spill cleanup substantially. 5 
The product is non-toxic to humans, animals, plants, and marine life. It contains no known allergens to cause skin, respiratory or other allergic reactions. 6  It contains no corrosive chemicals or metal trace elements, which will not damage any electrical insulation or painted surfaces.
