Dancin' On the Back Streets is the third album by the late-1980s hard rock band Blue Tears. Long after the band members got involved in other projects, some of their unreleased material started to surface on the Internet. Band leader Gregg Fulkerson decided to compile an album of most of this material and release it officially. That was the second compilation album, released the same year as Mad, Bad and Dangerous. It was released December 5, 2005.
