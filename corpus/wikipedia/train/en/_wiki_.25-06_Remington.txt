Considered by many as the most balanced of the "quarter bores" for hunting medium-sized game, the .25-06 Remington remained in obscurity as a wildcat cartridge for nearly half a century before being standardized by Remington in 1969. 
Its design was based on the .30-06 Springfield cartridge necked-down  to .257 caliber keeping a similar cartridge length of its parent case, thus being chambered in standard-length actions. Nominal bullet diameter is 0.257 in, and bullet weights range from 75 to 120 grains .
Charles Newton necked down the .30-06 Springfield cartridge in 1912 to accept a 117-grain .25-35 Winchester bullet, 3  but the resulting .256 Newton cartridge did not catch on. Newton's early modification encouraged commercial release of a shortened case  as the .250-3000 Savage in 1915. 4   Frankford Arsenal developed an experimental .25-06 during World War I; and distribution of surplus United States military equipment through the Civilian Marksmanship Program following the war encouraged independent gunsmiths to experiment with the cartridge. 3   A. O. Niedner of Dowagiac, Michigan, introduced rifles for the .25 Niedner in 1920. 5   Niedner Arms Corporation retained the 17° 30′ .30-06 shoulder chambering .25 caliber barrels rifled with one twist in 12 inches . 6   Similar cartridges were identified as the .25 Hi-Power, .25 Whelen , or .25-100-3000 .  Greater case capacity offered minimal velocity improvement over the .250-3000 Savage case with contemporary smokeless powders. 7   Availability of DuPont's Improved Military Rifle  powders encouraged commercial release of the .257 Roberts using the 57 mm Mauser case in 1934. 8   Release of IMR 4350 in 1940 and availability of surplus 4831 powder salvaged from Oerlikon 20 mm cannon cartridges after World War II greatly improved performance of the full-length .25-06 case. 9 
Most .25-caliber bullets have high ballistic coefficients without being heavy, which, combined with the large case capacity of its parent .30-06 case, allows relatively high muzzle velocities without heavy recoil.  The combination of high ballistic coefficients with high muzzle velocities gives the .25-06 a very flat trajectory as well as retaining kinetic energy down-range.
The cartridge is capable of propelling a 117 grain  bullet at up to 3,200 feet  per second  and energy levels up to 2,500 ft⋅lbf .  Bullets lighter than 75 grains are available in .257 caliber but were designed for the smaller .25-20 Winchester and .25-35 Winchester cartridges and are too lightly constructed for the high velocities of the .25-06.
The cartridge has less felt recoil than a .30-06 in a similar-weight rifle, due to the lighter-weight bullets used. Shooters who are recoil sensitive will find the recoil from the .25-06 easier on the shoulder, contributing to good shot placement. This cartridge is not quite as powerful as the .257 Weatherby Magnum, usually running 200–300 ft/s  slower with a given bullet weight, but almost 200 ft/s faster than the .257 Roberts at its hottest loads . 10 
SAAMI pressure limit for the .25-06 is 63,000 PSI.
The .25-06 is generally considered to be a good round for medium-sized game such as deer and antelope because of its combination of substantial kinetic energy and moderate recoil.  The addition of a flat trajectory makes it particularly popular in open terrains such as plains and mountains, where longer-range shots on game are not seldom, since its flat trajectory forgives range-estimation errors up to 300 yards if sighted to its maximum point blank range.  
Bullets of different weights and construction make the .25-06 Remington a fine alternative for hunting species ranging from prairie dogs and coyotes to mid-sized deer and sheep. Although capable of taking heavier game such as elk, many hunters prefer a larger caliber and a heavier bullet for larger species.  
Bullets range from lightly constructed 75-grain bullets with muzzle velocities in the 3,700 ft/s  range to more robust 120-grain bullets with muzzle velocities in the 3,000 ft/s  range. Most manufacturers of bolt-action or single-shot rifles offer the .25-06 as a standard chambering and factory loaded ammunition is available from Remington, Winchester, Federal Cartridge and most other major manufacturers.
