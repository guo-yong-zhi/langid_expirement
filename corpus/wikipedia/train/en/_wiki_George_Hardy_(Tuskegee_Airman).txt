Hardy's parents names were Edward Hardy and Alma Vargas. 1  He was exposed to racism and segregation growing up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 4  He graduated high school in 1942 and wanted to join the military because his older brother had joined the U.S. Navy in 1941. 5  When he joined the Army Air Corps in 1943 the U.S. military was segregated. 4  Hardy faced discrimination from commanders in the Army. 6  After WWII  Hardy went to school at New York University School of Engineering and Science until 1948. 7  Hardy wanted to be an Engineer, he did not plan to make a career in the Air Force. 8 
In 1943 when Hardy was 17, he joined the Army Air Corps that same year he began training to fly at the Tuskegee Air Field late. 4  6  He was deployed to Keesler Army Air Field in Biloxi, Mississippi for basic training. 3  He graduated in 1944 as a second Lieutenant in the United States Army. He was qualified to fly single-engine planes and sent to Walterboro Army Air Field in South Caroline to train for combat. He completed his combat training in 1945 and was then sent to Italy. 7  Hardy became one of only 350 Tuskegee Airmen who were deployed overseas.

He then was sent to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa: he flew a B-29 and  piloted 45 combat missions over Korea. 7  One senior officer, then-Lt Col Fred W.
