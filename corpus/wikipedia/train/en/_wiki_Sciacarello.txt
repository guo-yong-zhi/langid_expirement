Sciacarello  is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown primarily in Corsica. It is most noted for the wines that come from Ajaccio which tend to be highly perfumed. It is also associated with wines from Calvi, and in the Sartène region around Propriano. The grape is normally blended and rarely made into a varietal wine. 1  Sciacarello is believed to be a parent vine of the Ligurian-Tuscan wine grape, pollera nera. 2  Di Vecchi Staraz, Bandinelli, Boselli, This, Boursiquot, Laucou, Lacombe, and Varès  showed that Sciaccarello  and another Corsican variety Malvasia Montanaccio as well as Tuscan varieties Biancone, Caloria, Colombana Nera, and Pollera Nera have genetic ties to Mammolo. 3 
It makes a highly drinkable, soft and spicy red and rosé wine.
