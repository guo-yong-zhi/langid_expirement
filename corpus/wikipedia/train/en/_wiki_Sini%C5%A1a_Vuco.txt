Siniša Vuco , better known simply as Vuco, is a Croatian recording artist and singer-songwriter.
Vuco is best known in Croatia for his blend of hard rock and pop folk genres, emphasized by his baritone rock vocals. Majority of his songs have recurring themes such as addiction, alcoholism, unrequited love, misfortune and suffering. 3 
Siniša Vuco, began his career as a pop musician, but his big break came in early 1990s when he appeared in the Split Music Festival. 4  He presented himself as one of the first Croatian Pop musicians to reintroduce the accordion , Roma music and oriental sounds in his work, in a time when it was considered "politically incorrect" for Croatians to do so because it was somehow redolent of Turbo-folk music. Vuco, much to the dismay of pop/folk critics and social commentators, introduced elements of turbo-folk to Croatian pop music. 5 
Although officially frowned upon, such trends apparently struck the chord among a large section of the Croatian public and Vuco acquired a loyal following.
One of his newer singles is "Volim narodno"  in which he copied parts from popular song "We Will Rock You". The song is a duet with popular Serbian folk singer Mitar Mirić. He has also collaborated with other big names in the industry, which include Džej Ramadanovski and Vesna Zmijanac.
Apart from having a turbo-folk career, Siniša Vuco is a founder and vocalist and guitarist for the hard rock band Živo blato. While playing for Živo blato, he takes the stage name General Vasilij Mitu. He is also a member of the heavy metal band Klanje ljudi, 6  for which he performs using the stage name Admiral Koljač . Vuco played bass in a thrash metal band Evil Blood, 7  alongside drummer Toni Silobrčić and vocalist Denis Gabrić . Also he gained acclaim as the vocalist for heavy metal band Witchcraft.
Vuco has also written songs for others, some of which have become semi-hits, for example the song "Stari se" was written by him for Thompson. 4 
He is infamous for his often eccentric performances; for example: Klanje ljudi's Split concert of 2004 stands out as lambs were being roasted on stage as the band played, and spectators could simply walk up to the stage and grab a piece of lamb to eat.
Similar appearances occurred during the 2003 parliamentary elections when he appeared on Croatian Radiotelevision as an independent candidate. 8  Although many in Croatian public considered his TV presentation to be the most original and the most entertaining part of the entire campaign, most people saw his candidacy more as a publicity stunt than a genuine effort to start a political career.
Siniša Vuco was married twice and divorced once. He has four children, including Vilibald and Brigita.
