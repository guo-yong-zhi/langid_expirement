In probability theory and statistics, the Conway–Maxwell–binomial  distribution is a three parameter discrete probability distribution that generalises the binomial distribution in an analogous manner to the way that the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution generalises the Poisson distribution.  The CMB distribution can be used to model both positive and negative association among the Bernoulli summands,. 1  2 
The distribution was introduced by Shumeli et al. , 1  and the name Conway–Maxwell–binomial distribution was introduced independently by Kadane   2  and Daly and Gaunt . 3 
The Conway–Maxwell–binomial  distribution has probability mass function
