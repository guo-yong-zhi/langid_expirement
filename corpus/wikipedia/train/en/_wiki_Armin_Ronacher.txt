Armin Ronacher  is an Austrian open source software programmer and the creator of the Flask web framework for Python.
He is a frequent speaker at developer conferences and has a popular blog about software development and open source. 1 
Armin has a Bachelor's in Business Administration and Software Engineering from TU Graz, Austria. He did this from 2009-2012.
Armin Ronacher started his work in Open Source as a freelance developer for the German Ubuntu Community portal "ubuntuusers" 2  through which he later became a founding member of the German Ubuntu Association in 2005. 3 
While working on ubuntuusers Ronacher re-discovered the Python programming language and wrote some of the earliest implementations for WSGI with the goal to write a bulletin board in Python together with Georg Brandl. 4  This board was to be called "Pocoo" and to be a replacement for phpBB in Python. 5  While the bulletin board never managed a stable release, many other projects appeared out of the Pocoo umbrella project: the Pygments syntax highlighter, 6  the Sphinx documentation generator, the Jinja template engine and many other libraries for Python. He also contributed functionality for the Python AST module 7  and the Ordered Dict for Python. 8  After an elaborate April fool's joke where he bundled his libraries in a one-file microframework 9  he decided to create the Flask web framework. It went on to become one of the two most popular web development frameworks  for Python and the associated libraries found a new home under the "Pallets" 10  community.
He also created the Lektor CMS and contributed to a large list of Open Source applications and libraries.
He worked for Plurk, for Fireteam , 11  and most recently for the Sentry crash reporting tool.
Armin Ronacher is a frequent speaker at Open Source conferences around the world. 12
