The Waltham Petcare Science Institute is the science hub for Mars Petcare, owned by Mars, Incorporated located at Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire, United Kingdom. Waltham conducts scientific research into pet care and animal nutrition .
The pet food subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated  began research into pet nutrition in the early 1960s, formally founding a Nutrition Research Unit in 1965. 1  Originally the institute was housed at a nearby location but was moved to an old stud farm at Waltham-on-the-Wolds in 1973. 2 
Since 2001, a non-charitable organisation called the Waltham Foundation has funded a number of humane scientific research projects dedicated to furthering the health and nutrition of companion animals. 3 
An August 2019 documentary on Channel 4 made by Whitworth Media featured the site. 4 
Waltham houses and cares for around 200 dogs and 350 cats. The companion animals involved with the organisation are adopted after a period of time. The UK headquarters of Mars was built next to the Centre in 1981.
There is another research site at Verden an der Aller in north Germany, at Mars Petcare's largest factory in Europe.
