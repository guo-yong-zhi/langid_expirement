Tambelin railway station is located on the Gawler line. 1  Situated in the northern Adelaide suburb of Evanston Gardens, it is 37.4 kilometres  from the Adelaide station. 
The sign for Tambelin was erected by the S.A.Railways at a new stopping place near what was then known as the "23-mile crossing" in 1947. The name had not previously been a locality name in the area that had been known as Gawler Blocks. The name Tambelin was chosen by the S.A.R. after consulting the South Australian Nomenclature Committee, as a native name meaning "selecting". 2 
Prior to 1986, Tambelin station had short step-down platforms on the northern side of Clark Road; the present station was built in 1986 on the south side of Clark Road. It has an unsealed carpark and serves Trinity College via a footpath underneath the Gawler Bypass. 3 
Tambelin has two side platforms and is serviced by Adelaide Metro. It is a designated high-frequency station, with trains scheduled every 15 minutes on weekdays, between 7:30am and 6:30pm. 4
