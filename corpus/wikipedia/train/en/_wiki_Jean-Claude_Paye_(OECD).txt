Jean-Claude Paye  is a former French diplomat and civil servant who served as the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  from 1984 to 1996, excluding a brief gap in 1994.
Paye is the son of Lucien Paye, who was Minister of National Education in the 1960s. He attended the National School of Administration. Paye was a highranking official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before becoming Secretary-General of the OECD in 1984, in place of Emiel van Lennep of the Netherlands. His ten-year term ended in September 1994 after the United States blocked an extension of his term. 1  However, after further negotiations it was agreed that Paye would stay on for an additional two years before being succeeded by Canada's Don Johnston. 2
