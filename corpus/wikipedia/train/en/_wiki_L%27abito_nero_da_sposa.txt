L'abito nero da sposa was distributed by Produttori Associatti in Italy on May 17, 1945. 1  Zampa later spoke on about his early films, stating that he "prefer not to remember . They taught me how to move the camera and direct the actors. But I never tried to watch them again, there is nothing inside them. They were just spectacles." 2
