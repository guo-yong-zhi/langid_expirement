The Ducati Vento is a 340 cc  single cylinder bevel drive SOHC motorcycle produced by the Spanish manufacturer MotoTrans, who were licensed by Ducati to produce motorcycles under the Ducati brand name and was produced from 1978 to 1983. 1  The model is based on the 350 'wide case' Ducati singles which the Italian Ducati factory had stopped manufacturing in 1974, but which MotoTrans continued to develop and produce. 5  The machine had café racer styling 6  and was intended to be a successor to the earlier 24 Horas. 7 
A prototype was shown at the 1974 Automobile Barcelona Show alongside the touring Forza. 4  The prototype had a single front disc brake and wire wheels. 1  2 
A second prototype was later shown with twin front discs and cast wheels. 1 
The machine went into production in 1976 with a redesigned frame. 8  A racing seat, clip-ons and rearsets were fitted. Compression ratio was increased to 10:1 and a 32mm Dell'Orto PHF carburettor fitted, 7  which raised engine power to 28 bhp . 1  To save weight, the electric starter used on the Forza was not fitted. 4  Most of the machines were finished in green, but some later machines were finished in red. 4  They were sold mainly in the Spanish Market. 7 
Production was suspended in late 1981 due to MotoTrans being in financial trouble, but resumed in the Summer of 1982. The next year, 1983, production stopped when the company went into receivership. 7 
The single cylinder bevel drive OHC engine was of unit construction and had an alloy head and alloy barrel with cast iron liners. Bore and stroke were 76 mm × 75 mm  giving a displacement of 340 cc . A 10:1 piston was fitted. Claimed power output was 28 bhp  @ 8,000 rpm, giving the machine a top speed of 165 km/h . 1  2 
Fuel was delivered by a 32mm Dell'Orto PHF carburettor. 7  The engine used wet sump lubrication and ignition was by battery and coil. 2
