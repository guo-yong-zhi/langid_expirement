The Red Thread is the fourth studio album by Scottish indie rock band Arab Strap, released on 26 February 2001 by Chemikal Underground.
Aidan Moffat of Arab Strap has commented on the title of the album, saying:
It's an Eastern belief that you're connected to your life partner by an invisible red thread and by that you will always find each other. It works both as a romantic thing and a comfort just in case it all goes wrong because you've still not followed the thread. It's relevant to the doubts that are expressed in some of the songs. 10 All tracks are written by Malcolm Middleton and Aidan Moffat
