The relative strength of two systems of formal logic can be defined via model theory. Specifically, a logic 
  
    
      
         
      
    
    
  
 is said to be as strong as a logic 
  
    
      
         
      
    
    
  
 if every elementary class in 
  
    
      
         
      
    
    
  
 is an elementary class in
