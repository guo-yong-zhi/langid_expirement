DCP Gopal Iyer is an encounter specialist. He comes across a Muslim woman named Nasreen, whose father is killed by gangsters. Out of pity, he marries her much against his parents' opposition. Suddenly, Nasreen passes away in a childbirth. Meanwhile, Jenniffer, a scribe, learns of a fake encounter organized by Iyer to bump off a known rowdy. She follows him from then, blackmailing him, but Iyer, who thinks that evil forces do not deserve a chance in the court, does not change his style of operations. Elsewhere, a mute gangster named Venkatachalapathy, who is imprisoned after being apprehended by Iyer, vows to kill him. Now aware that his son kills people in the name of encounters, Iyer's father decides to take cudgels against him. He falls in to the vicious trap of Venkatachalapathy, and the rest is about how Iyer embarks on a mission to rescue his family and put an end to Venkatachalapathy's shenanigans.
Soundtrack was composed by Dhina. 4 
Indiaglitz wrote "Lengthy dialogues and needless stunts make the watching even more tedious." 5  Thiraipadam wrote "With almost no story to speak of, a disjointed screenplay, inane characterization and overacting by almost all the main performers, this one easily wrests the crown  for the most inept movie with a policeman as hero, in recent times." 6  Chennai Online wrote "The weak script, inane charecterisation and the director being totally like a fish out of water in the milieu he's chosen, have all taken their toll on Satyaraj's performance too." 7
