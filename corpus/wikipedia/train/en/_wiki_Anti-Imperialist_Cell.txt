The Anti-Imperialist Cell  was a German far-left militant organization responsible for several terrorist attacks from 1992 to 1995. The AIZ began its existence on 22 May 1992, branding itself as the successor to the inactive Red Army Faction. They published their first communiqué in 1994, with the stated mission to attack "elites" of reunified Germany and their representatives at their jobs or residences. The organization committed nine bombing, shooting and arson attacks against German state and political right-wing targets, ultimately resulting in no deaths. 1  2 
On 25 February 1996, Bernhard Falk and Michael Steinau were arrested for involvement in the activities of the AIZ, and on 1 September 1999, were convicted by the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf for four counts of attempted murder, receiving sentences of 9 and 13 years imprisonment, respectively. Falk and Steinau are the only known members of the AIZ, which investigators assumed had a larger membership, and are presumed to be the only members as attacks by the organization ended immediately after their arrest.
