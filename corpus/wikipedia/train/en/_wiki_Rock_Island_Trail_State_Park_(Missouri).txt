The Rock Island Spur of Katy Trail State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Missouri that is 47-mile   rails to trails hiking and biking trail.  Work on the trail was completed and the trail was opened on December 10, 2016 . 1   The trail provides residents of the Kansas City region direct trail access to the 240 mi  Katy Trail State Park, the longest rails to trails trail in the U.S.  The Rock Island Trail uses "abandoned"  right-of-way of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad between Pleasant Hill in Cass County and Windsor in Henry County where it meets the Katy Trail. 2 
An additional 144 miles  of Rock Island right-of-way is in the process of rail banking by the Surface Transportation Board. Missouri State Parks is evaluating adding this additional 144 miles to the Rock Island Trail, extending it from Windsor to Beaufort. 3   On December 19, 2019, the state signed an Interim Trail Use Agreement with Missouri Central Railroad Company, the Ameren subsidiary that owns the corridor.  The agreement paves the way for transfer of the right-of-way to the state if certain conditions can be met by December 31, 2021, including identifying approximately 9.8 million dollars of funding. 3  
If completed the combined Rock Island and Katy trails will form a network of 450 miles . 4  5 
In May 2016, Jackson County, Missouri acquired 17.7 miles  of right-of-way from  the Union Pacific Railroad, of section of line from the Truman Sports Complex to south part of Lee's Summit, to bring the trail into Kansas City. Work began in 2017, with the first half opened in 2018. There currently is a gap between Lee's Summit/Greenwood and Pleasant Hill, with the route unknown at this time. 6  7  8
