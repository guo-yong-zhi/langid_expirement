"Compare Sam Ward with the only black millionaire in New York, I mean Jerry Hamilton; and it is plain that manhood is a 'nobler ideal' than money. The former has illustrated his people and his country, the other has fled from his identity,  like a dog with a tin kettle tied to his tail! There is, no doubt, dearest Ethiop, that in the language of Scripture, you are 'black, but comely.'"
