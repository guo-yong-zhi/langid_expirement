The 16th Sarki was Abdulahi Burja. His mother’s name was Tekidda.
There was no one like him for generosity. He was the first in Hausaland to give Bornu “tsare or gaisua.” He opened roads from Bornu to Gwanja. He was the first to own camels in Hausaland.
Sarkin Bornu left his country at this time and went to attack Asben, but as he could not find any water for his army he returned home. The next year every town in the west paid him “tsare.” The Sarkin Kano went out to Khud and encamped there one year and six months. The Galadima Daudu went to wage war in the south. In Burja’s time Karmashi conquered the Migawa. The Sarki went to Dussi. The Galadima Daudu said to him, “Return to Kano, I will do for you whatever you want done, and defeat your enemies.”
So the Sarkin Kano returned home. When he arrived in Kano, he found that Dagachi had assumed great power in the town, and collected wealth without end, and had built houses from his house as far as Salamta. It was Dagachi who made the market of Karabka. All this time the Galadima Daudu was in the south making war on the pagans every day, conquering them and taking them as slaves. Every month he sent 1,000 slaves to Sarkin Kano. All the people of Kano flocked to him. There was no one left in Kano except the Sarki and very old men. Every day the Sarki sent to the Galadima horses, clothes and horse trapping.
The Galadima was sung as follows:
He stayed 7 years in the south. Slaves became very numerous in Kano. The Sarki sent to him to tell him to come back, so he returned. When he was returning, he stopped every 3 miles, and built a town. He left at each 1,000 slaves, 500 males, and 500 females. He thus founded 21 towns, before he came to Kano. On arriving there he gave the Sarki 3,000 slaves and said to him, “I have founded 21 towns, and in each I have left 1,000 slaves, all yours.”
The Sarki asked him, “What are the names of the towns you have built?”
The Galadima said, “Their names are Ibdabu.”
The Sarki said, “I make you ruler of all these towns and their domains.”
Because of this the Galadima was called “Daudu, the strength of the city.”
The next year the Sarki sent to Dussi to ask for a wife. He was the first Sarki who married a daughter of Sarkin Dussi, Sarkin Shirra and Sarkin Eano, and also a daughter of the Galadima.
He ruled 15 years.
