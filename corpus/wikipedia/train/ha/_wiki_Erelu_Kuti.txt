The Ikadan palace was the home of Erelu Kuti, mother of Ologun Kutere  and Shokun The first Oba of Lagos was Ado, the son of Prince Ashipa from Isheri Olofin and the daughter of the Oba of Benin Kingdom .  Ado had three children, Gabbaro, Akinsemoyin and a female, Erelu Kuti. After the death of Ado, his eldest son, Gabbaro, succeeded him. Gabarro's line became extinct because he had no child. Therefore, upon his death, Akinsemoyin, his younger brother, succeeded to the crown.While Akinsemoyin was ruling, Erelu Kuti married Alagba, the high priest that had predicted that her brother would become Oba. Alagba, an Ijesha man from Ilesha, subsequently served as a chief in the court of his brother-in-law.Oba Akinsemoyin built a palace called Iga Alagba at Idumota for him because he could not belong to the Oba's household as a non-member of the royal family. Akinsemoyin, according to clan history, subsequently had a set of male triplets after having a number of daughters. Because it was a taboo in those days to have twins, let alone triplets, the three boys were smuggled out of the palace. Due to the poor condition under which they were kept, two of them died, leaving one alive. This son went on to live an ordinary life as a commoner.Due to this, when Akinsemoyin died in 1749 after ruling for 44 years, Ologun Kutere  was made Oba in his stead. Though the late king is said to have had other sons after the set of triplets, they are said to have been very young at the time of their father's death.A yanzu masana tarihin kabilanci sun yarda da cewa saboda girman Akinsemoyin, bai ga bukatar dawwamar da mulkinsa na daular ba ta hanyar sanya daya daga cikin manyan 'ya'yansa mata ta zama mai mulki, har sai lokacin da manyan 'ya'yansa maza suka manyanta.

On the advice of Alagba, Akinsemoyin performed certain rituals and ceremonies which included putting up a white flag on what is now Victoria Island.An ce a sakamakon haka, mutanen kasar Portugal sun zo kuma daga baya sun taimaka wajen ci gaban gine-ginen masarautarsa.

Satisfied that all was now well with Oba Akinsemoyin and his people, Alagba then expressed the desire to return to Ilesha for the remaining part of his life. Oba Akinsemoyin agreed and, in gratitude for his years of service, offered him any of his daughters as a wife.While they were talking about this, Erelu passed by and heard what they were discussing. At a later time, she told her brother that she would gladly marry Alagba if he wished it to be so. ana buƙatar hujja
