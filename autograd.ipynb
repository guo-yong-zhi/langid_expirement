The shock originated in the Hansel Valley at the north end of the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States. Damage was mostly confined to vulnerable buildings, and two people died. The dip-slip  fault that generated the shock ruptured the surface of the ground and other geologic features were documented. A large aftershock occurred three hours after the initial event and may have caused additional damage.\\nSituated in southern Nevada, Utah, Idaho, western Wyoming and western Montana, the Intermountain Seismic Belt  is a region of crustal stretching and intraplate deformation. This results in a 810 mi  zone of active tectonics, with uplift in the mountains and comparative subsidence in the valleys. This area follows California and Western Nevada in the lower 48 states in terms of seismic risk. 1 \\nWithin the ISB, the Basin and Range Province is a region of extensional tectonics and lays between the Sierra Nevada in the west and the Colorado Plateau in the east. It comprises north-trending mountains that are mostly uniform in height and are separated by flat valleys with mostly consistent widths. The prevalent fault type in this area is dip-slip . 2 \\nThe magnitude 6.6 shock occurred on an unnamed and north-trending normal fault that slipped over a distance of 6.8 miles . Surface rupture was present but may not have reached the surface over the entire length. The maximum vertical offset was 1 foot 8 inches . 3 \\nSeveral hundred aftershocks occurred over the following days and weeks. The most significant of these was a magnitude 5.9 shock that took place a little over three hours after the mainshock. The damage that resulted from this less severe event could not be distinguished from the initial one, but it was also felt in Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming. 4  5 \\nSeveral other events made the record books at the University of Utah. On March 15, there were two shocks of magnitude 5.1 and 4.8 with assumed  intensities of VI  and V . Around one month later on April 14 there was another earthquake of magnitude 5.6 with an observed intensity of VII  and on May 6 another one also measured at 5.6 with an intensity of VI . 6 \\nThe mainshock is depicted by a United States Geological Survey isoseismal map with a relatively small zone with the maximum felt intensity of VIII  at the north end of the Great Salt Lake. Salt Lake City and the extreme southern portion of Idaho lay in the intensity VI  zone and Pocatello, Idaho lay just to the north within the intensity V  zone. 5 \\nThe most significant aftershock took place on the same day as the mainshock. The National Geophysical Data Center declared that its intensity peaked at VI  only in Utah at Kosmo and Monument. It was felt with an intensity of V  in Logan and Ogden, both in Utah. Pocatello and Twin Falls, Idaho both reported an intensity of IV , as did Salt Lake City. At 400 miles  distant from the epicentral area, it was felt in Cheyenne, Wyoming with an intensity of III . 7 \\nThe meizoseismal area was mostly unpopulated, but there were a few small towns that experienced damage to mostly weaker structures. Cracked walls and damage to chimneys was reported in Logan, Hooper, Kelton, Kosmo, Locomotive Springs, Monument, and Snowville. At least two people were killed. 5 \\nFollowing a 20th-century field survey of the affected areas, features such as large rock slides, previously dormant wells and springs, and an increase in the flow of an oil seep were documented. The surveyor reported that in areas where surface faulting was present, it was discontinuous and it did not occur in bedrock and was mostly observed in unconsolidated rocks or salt flats. 8 \\nIn the 21st-century, seismologists were able to validate that the surface ruptures were of tectonic origin  using a vertical seismic profile process. This modern technique uses various instruments placed in boreholes along an area of interest, which gather data from an artificial seismic source. The study showed that the slip was vertical near the surface, but horizontal at depth, indicating a transtensional environment. 9 \\nThe Salt Lake City and County Building was dedicated in 1894 well before earthquake engineering developed. For some time it was Utah's tallest building and it experienced minor damage during earthquakes, including the 1934 shock. The building was eventually retrofitted with a seismic base isolation system to avoid resonance of the building during future events. 10 \\n\" => \"eng\", \"The 1985 Appalachian State Mountaineers football team was an American football team that represented Appalachian State University as a member of the Southern Conference  during the 1985 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

There—together with Yakov Sverdlov—he set up a local Bolshevik organization. In May 1912 he fled and returned to Omsk, where he was arrested the next month, and imprisoned for a year. He was transferred to Tambov to live independently under police surveillance, but soon fled again, whereafter he spent 1913–14 encouraging civil unrest in the cities of Saint Petersburg, Kharkov, and Vologda. He relocated to  Samara in 1917; and became president of the local soviet—a position he held at the time of the 1917 October Revolution and for the next year.

It was designed by Thomas Pye and Block A was built from 1914 to 1915. It is also known as Warwick Technical College and Warwick Intermediate School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 June 2018. 1 \\nWarwick State High School opened on this site in 1914 as the Warwick Technical College and High School, accommodated in new buildings; having relocated operations from an earlier site in Guy Street. It grew to include Queensland's first intermediate school in 1929, accommodated in a new building in 1932, and developed further to cater for increased high school enrolments in the 1950s and 1960s in new buildings. The buildings were purpose-designed by the Department of Public Works  and form an attractive cohesive group of state educational buildings from the early to mid-20th century. These are: 1 \\nPrior to British settlement, the open country of the Darling Downs, named by Allan Cunningham in 1827, had been carefully and deliberately maintained by its Aboriginal owners in an annual pattern of controlled burns to preserve pasture for native grazing animals. 2  British settlement of the Darling Downs, began in 1840 with the Leslie Brothers who were closely followed by other graziers. The town of Warwick, which grew to become the business centre for the southern Darling Downs, was surveyed by James Charles Burnett in 1849, with the first sale of crown land in July 1850. Warwick was declared a municipality in 1861 and was subsequently transformed from a squatters' town into the principal urban centre of this prosperous pastoral and agricultural district. The construction of the Southern railway line linking Brisbane, Toowoomba, Warwick and the tin mines of Stanthorpe reached Warwick in January 1871, and fuelled further development. As Warwick grew, its local industries remained related to primary production including: flour milling, butter and cheese production, bacon processing, sawmilling, coach and wagon works, followed in the 20th century by motor repairs and engineering works. All of these industries required a skilled workforce. 3  4  1 \\nThroughout the 19th century, the only avenue for technical education in Queensland was through the local schools of arts where courses in trades were conducted. The quality and variety of instruction depended on the competence and enthusiasm of committee members. During the late 1880s, several committees established technical colleges in existing school of arts buildings, but as the range of courses and number of students increased, separate accommodation was necessary. Queensland's first purpose-built technical college was the Queen Victoria Silver Jubilee Memorial Technical Collegewhich opened in Ipswich in 1901, followed by Warwick's , Mount Morgan Technical College , and Toowoomba Technical College  . Reflecting the importance of the mining industry to Charters Towers, the Charters Towers School of Mines was established in there in 1901, which fulfilled a similar role to a technical college but with a focus on mining. 1 \\nIn the early 1900s the Queensland Government began to take a more active interest in technical colleges. In the late 1890s through to 1914, Queensland's manufacturing sector grew substantially, creating a need for a more skilled workforce in a variety of trades. 1 \\nThe Board of Technical Education was established in 1902, replaced by a Technical Education Branch within the Department of Public Instruction in 1905, and the Technical Instruction Act 1908 empowered the government to take over existing technical colleges. Locally managed technical colleges gradually came under departmental control and the government also established new colleges in several centres, including Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Mackay. 5  1 \\nTechnical education in Warwick began with the formation of a school of arts, which initially met in the courthouse before establishing itself in a building in Palmerin Street in 1869. A technical college began in the School of Arts boardroom in 1895. This space was soon inadequate and a site was acquired on the corner of Fitzroy and Guy Street where a new building was opened in 1906, financed through local subscriptions. A two-storey extension facing Guy Street was completed in 1909. 6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  1 \\nConcurrently, an approach had been made to the Minister for Public Instruction to offer high school education in Warwick at the technical college. This phase of education was referred to as a Day School. The Warwick Day School began classes in the Guy Street technical college on 1 July 1910. Warwick was the first town in regional Queensland to have a technical high school under government control. The Warwick Technical High School was officially opened on 8 August 1910. It was noted that during the previous 4.5 years, £5,812 had been spent on technical college works in Warwick, £2,450 of which were raised locally and that the college had been handed over to the government free of debt. 6  9  14  15  11  16  17  18  19  20  1 \\nDemand for further education was high and by December 1910 it was evident that a new site was needed for a larger technical college and high school. After a local referendum in September 1912, two acres  of land was resumed from Cunningham Park in 1913 for a new technical college and high school. Cunningham Park was originally part of the Town Reserve surveyed in 1849, dedicated as a reserve for Public Recreation in 1855 and gazetted as a Recreation Reserve in 1868. In 1901, this reserve was divided into two 10 acre  reserves creating Leslie Park in the southern section and Cunningham Park in the northern section. 21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  1 \\nQueensland prosperity grew in the first decades of the 20th century from a mineral boom and agricultural pursuits, enabling the government to implement a campaign of construction of large public buildings. 30  This included substantial brick or timber school buildings. From the beginnings of purpose-built education buildings until the 1950s, brick school buildings were far less frequently built than those of timber. If brick was employed, it was only in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly-increasing populations. Like Queensland's private schools, technical colleges and schools of arts, rather than being built to a standard plan, all brick and some timber school buildings were individually designed with variation in style, size, and form. These few were given generous budgets, resulting in impressive edifices. Light and ventilation was still a primary concern for the architects but compared to contemporary standard education buildings, these buildings had a grander character and greater landmark attributes. 31  1 \\nQueensland Government Architect Thomas Pye called tenders for the new Warwick Technical College and High School buildings in July 1913. HD Miller's £11,500 tender was accepted in August, but the contract was later awarded to Donald James Hutchings. The foundation stone was laid 28 February 1914 by the Queensland Governor, Sir William McGregor. 32  33  34  35  1 \\nThe main Technical College and High School building  was a two-storey masonry structure on a Greymare granite base, with a Marseilles tiled roof with a fleche. The walls were face brick and roughcast stucco with Yangan freestone dressings. A carved sandstone coat of arms over the doorway featured the motto of the school: \\\"Virtute et Labore\\\" , carved by the art master Charles Astley. The interior, with its wide entrance hall with reinforced concrete staircase, provided teaching space for commercial subjects, chemistry, and a lecture and examination hall. The building included a two-storey toilet block joined by a first floor walkway. The block had an iron fire escape stair and a concrete septic tank was added to the rear  of the block in 1923. 36  37  38  1 \\nA separate two-storey Workshops Block  was built prior to Block A, standing to its west. It was completed in May 1914 when classes commenced, while earlier Technical College in Guy Street, remained in use for some time. Block B housed a blacksmithing and plumbing workshop and two forges on the ground floor, with a carpenter and joinery workshop and a geometric drawing room on the first floor. 39  40  1 \\nBoth buildings were heated by gas, and served by electricity, with synchronised clocks. The buildings cost in excess of £12,000 and were officially opened by the Queensland Governor, His Excellency Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, in October 1915. The school buildings complemented existing substantial masonry structures in Warwick, many also built using Yangan freestone. Pye was acting Government Architect and responsible for numerous substantial government buildings including the Toowoomba Technical College, Mackay Technical College, Rockhampton Technical College 600789 and Brisbane's Central Technical College. The granite and sandstone were locally sourced with the granite coming from Greymare, about 30 km west of Warwick. 41  42  43  44  40  39  45  46  47  48  49  1 \\nEducational reforms between 1909 and 1914 resulted in the introduction of high schools, expansion of technical colleges, inauguration of the University of Queensland, and initiation of a teachers training college. Warwick was fast becoming a \\\"school town\\\", with the opening of a number of private boarding and day schools from 1912 offering primary and secondary education. These included: Our Lady of the Assumption College , St Joseph's Christian Brothers College for boys ; Church of England Girls School ; Presbyterian Girls' College ; Scots College  and the Slade School . The Queensland Country Women's' Association provided hostel accommodation to students attending Warwick State High School from January 1928. 50  4  51  52  53  54  1 \\nArt master of the Warwick Technical College from 1908 was Charles Astley , an accomplished artist and musician. He learnt woodcarving from Edith Robinson and taught art classes on behalf of the technical college at Milton Ladies College , Tannymorel, Clifton, Stanthorpe, and Killarney. He began teaching china painting in 1914, which required kiln firing, so he also initiated pottery classes. Warwick acquired a pottery kiln in May 1918, prior to Brisbane's Central Technical College where pottery had been taught since 1916. The first kiln was located on the ground floor of the workshops block but Astley had difficulties with this kiln. A new imported kiln was purchased in 1922 and a small brick lean-to room was added to the rear  of the workshops block, costing £75 and built to accommodate it. This kiln was connected into a pre-existing chimney. The chimney was most likely part of the original construction of the workshops block  despite not appearing on original drawings. 1 \\nWarwick Technical College, under Astley's direction, pioneered the teaching and production of pottery in Queensland. This was more than a decade prior to the inclusion of ceramics courses in institutions such as the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Astley's students' pottery work was exhibited in the Brisbane Exhibition in 1921 and 1923 and he submitted a display to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium in 1924, for which he received a bronze medal. Astley's health failed, and following a brief time during 1925 when he established the art department at the Rockhampton Technical College, he was forced to retire at age 56, and died in 1929. Many of his works are retained in private collections, and some are held in the Queensland Art Gallery and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Astley  was a major figure in the cultural life of Warwick, having organised and participated in an orchestral concert in May 1912, to fund-raise for the new technical college building. Astley experimented with local clays, sourced from Stanthorpe, Sladeville and Rosenthal. One piece by Gladys Fell,  \\\"Kookaburra bowl\\\", is part of the Queensland Art Gallery collection. Charles Astley also pioneered wood carving and established a successful correspondence art course while at Warwick Technical College. Astley's granddaughter Thea was one of Queensland's most accomplished authors. 55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  1 \\nThe next phase of the development of the school campus came with the introduction of an intermediate school. This concept emerged in Queensland during the late 1920s, as a transition between primary and secondary schooling. Intermediate schools catered for years six and seven, and offered vocational subjects as well as a transition towards the Junior  and Senior  Certificates. Junior Certificates were available for General, Commercial Industrial, Home Science, Agriculture or Art. The completion of Senior could lead to enrolment at the University of Queensland, which at that time offered 25 scholarships per year. The intermediate system operated until the early 1960s. 17  69  70  1 \\nThe first state intermediate schools were established within existing school facilities at Warwick, Charters Towers, Mount Morgan and South Brisbane from 1928. In February 1929, the Minister for Education, the Hon. Thomas Wilson, opened the first intermediate school in Queensland at the Warwick Technical College and High School. The first group of 98 students were housed in the top storey of the workshops block. The top floor of the old Technical College in Guy Street was used for manual arts training. Queensland's first purpose-built intermediate school was opened in Roma in December 1929. 71  72  73  74  75  1 \\nA new purpose-built Intermediate School building, the second in Queensland, was erected at Warwick Technical College in 1932 . It was designed by DPW architect Harold Parr and built by Thomas R Porter for £7866. It was situated at right angles to the existing buildings, overlooking Cunningham Park, and was built to a complementary design. The two storey building had a Greymare granite base with face brick and roughcast stucco walls, stucco quoins, bands and architraves, and a tall hipped roof clad with tiles with a central metal ventilation fleche. The ground floor comprised four classrooms separated by folding partitions to allow conversion for assemblies, teachers room, and toilets. The first floor had two classrooms, a drawing, and a science room, teachers room, and toilets. The classrooms on both levels, were on the southern side of the building with banks of large casement windows enabling high levels of southern light and natural ventilation. The Minister for Education, the Hon. Frank Cooper, officially opened the building on 7 October 1932, and classes began in November. 76  77  78  79  80  81  1 \\nBy 1937, there were intermediate schools established in Brisbane South (Brisbane State High School, Block H) (1929), Mount Morgan State High School) (1929), Roma (1929), Charters Towers (1929), Gatton (1933), Gympie (1933), Bundaberg (1933), Mackay (Mackay Central State School) (1933), Brisbane North (Kelvin Grove) (1935), Maryborough Girls and Boys (Maryborough Boys Grammar School) (1936), and Ayr (Ayr State High School) (1936). Most were accomplished through re-use or remodelling of existing buildings. Six buildings at Roma, Warwick, Mackay, Bundaberg (demolished), Ayr, and Brisbane North (Kelvin Grove) were purpose-built structures. 82  1 \\nFrom 1948, land parcels approximately 300m to the north of the school, close to the river, were gradually resumed to provide new school land separate from the main campus. From 1950, a committee of parents, staff, and past students had fund-raised to convert this paddock into a sports field; named Hamilton Oval in 1951. In 1954, further land was acquired to establish an agricultural school. Both land areas were later amalgamated . Hamilton Oval was named after the first principal of the technical college and high school, Robert Campbell Hamilton, who was principal from 1914 until 1948. The Agricultural School building, designed by Jim Levin was completed in 1962. 83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  1 \\nThe campus was connected to the town's sewerage system in 1943. This necessitated a number of changes of fixtures and fittings of most plumbing items throughout the school. 95  96  97  1 \\nIn the late 1950s, two two-storey connecting wings were built; a north wing between Block A and B and a south wing between Block A and C, within the school's restrained 2 acre  site. This created an enclosed courtyard campus. From 1 July 1957 construction began on the South Connecting Wing between Blocks A and C at a cost of £19,693. The project included the re-use of freestone removed from the window openings of the technical college building, cut and dressed to be reused in the new wing, and was designed to have \\\"sympathetic consideration of the aesthetic relationship\\\" to the existing structure in order to \\\"preserve its integrity\\\". It housed science labs on the ground floor and classrooms on the first floor. It was completed by 1 March 1958. 98  99  100  101  102  103  1 \\nWork began immediately on the North Connecting Wing between Block A and B. This link, with large banks of awning windows, was designed by consulting architect Jim Leven. The wing, built in brick and timber, cost £28,064 and was likely completed by December 1959. It did not repeat all design elements of the early structures but was consciously designed so as not to detract from the existing structures. Three classrooms were provided on the ground floor with art, drawing, and dressmaking accommodated on the well-lit first floor. Both connecting wings illustrate DPW's commitment to improved lighting and ventilation for schools at this time. The upper floor of Block B was used for woodworking with bench accommodation for 32 students. Timber was stored in the loft. The ground floor was to be converted for welding, plumbing and metalwork. 104  105  106  107  108  109  1 \\nCunningham Park, occupying the land adjacent to the school, was used for sporting activities by the public and school community. The school constructed a tennis court and cricket pitch within the park during the 1930s . The EJ Portley Olympic Pool opened in October 1957 in the southeast corner of Cunningham Park. In August 1964, the two acre  site was gazetted as a Reserve for School Purposes . In 1966, the Warwick State High School Parents and Citizens' Association  requested control over this land, because Hamilton Oval was too far away for lunch-time sport and recreation. 110  89  111  112  113  1 \\nFurther additions were made to the school in the 1960s. A plumbing workshop  was completed at the commencement of the 1963 school year. The 98 ft  by 38 ft  slab on ground brick veneer and steel portal frame building, with east-facing skylight cost £17,500 and comprised two large workshop rooms, one for metalwork and one for plumbing. This was built to a standard type developed by the DPW. The north–south alignment of this building provided easy access for materials delivered directly from Victoria Street into a large door facing the street. Concurrently, the intermediate school ceased to exist with the demise of the Scholarship exam. 91  114  115  116  1 \\nThe Education Act 1964 was a turning point and the first major update of Queensland education's governing legislation since 1875. Effectively, a new era of state education evolved, requiring new architectural responses. The Department of Education  continued to give the responsibility of building design to the architects of the DPW. In 1964 construction began on a new brick and timber Science and Toilet Block extension with  extending from the west end of Block C. Extensive ground floor toilets and showers were built first , costing £20,475, and science laboratories with preparation rooms were subsequently added to the first floor  costing \\$70,420. The series of south-facing classrooms had large banks of windows to provide ample natural light and ventilations and were accessed by a long northern verandah. Minor alterations were made the west end of Block C for connecting access. The new building was built to a standard DPW plan, which included steel open web floor joists to provide unencumbered space underneath. This space was generally open for recreation, but at Warwick's small site it had to accommodate much needed toilets and showers. 117  118  119  120  121  122  123  1 \\nThe construction of Block D highlighted the diminishing recreational space on the school campus. The P & C sought the allocation of Cunningham Park to the school, which led to: the cancellation of the Recreation Reserve ; extension of the school reserve  and creation of a new reserve on the south western side of the park. The swimming pool was in a separate reserve. These were all gazetted in November 1968. The extension of the school reserve 8.9m to the west allowed for the construction of a new science wing at that time. 91  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  1 \\nIn July 1977 Warwick State High School officially acquired the adjacent land  as part of the high school and the campus grew into this space. With new educational philosophies from the mid-1960s-1980s, government policies and functional requirements combined with new architectural styles, materials and technologies, the evolution of standard designs became more fragmented. Rather than \\\"improving\\\" on the previous designs, architects began to design with inspiration drawn from new precedents. Fundamentally, timber construction was no longer favoured and buildings were no longer predominantly highset. 132  133  1 \\nFund-raising began for the construction of a hall in the early 1970s. The Great Hall was completed in 1977 and a First Year Centre in 1978. This was built on vacant land between Block C and the council swimming pool. This building blocked any views of Block C to and from Palmerin Street and the former Cunningham Park, which it originally overlooked. The beautification of the school grounds during the late 1970s and early 1980s have been credited to the principal Bob Rasmussen and his family; particularly the maintenance of the gardens facing Palmerin Street. 134  135  1 \\nIn c. 1978 Block F was extended to the west and the ground floor of the North Connecting Wing was altered to accommodate additional art classes, including the demolition of columns and the wall between classrooms and the corridor. A new library building was completed in 1986. 136  1 \\nWarwick State High School continued to provide technical education evening classes for tradesmen into the 1980s, until the establishment of the Warwick TAFE College in 1988. The conversion of the upper floor of Block B into a drama theatre in the early 1980s saw the carpentry work shop benches transferred to Block F. In c. 2001 a second extension was made on the west side of Block F to accommodate increased manual training facilities. A new art/science block was completed in 2006. In 2004 the school site merged Lots 1 W30106  and Lot 2 W30131  creating Lot 3 SP171821. 137  1 \\nThe school celebrated its centenary in 2002 with a significant publication acknowledging the history and achievements of the school. In 2016, the school enrolments for Warwick State High School were 893. In 2018 Warwick State High School continues to operate from its original site and retains its two-storey brick Technical College and High School building, Workshops Block, Intermediate School and 1950s North and South Connecting Wings, and former Plumbing Workshop and Science Wing with Toilet Block extension. It remains the only state high school in Warwick and is a key social focus for the community, as generations of students have been taught there and many social events held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment. 138  1 \\nWarwick State High School occupies a large  site fronting east to Palmerin Street, the main thoroughfare in Warwick. It is bounded on its other sides by Victoria Street to the north, Guy Street to the west, and other community buildings to the south. 1 \\nThe seven significant buildings within the school complex are: 1 \\nThe buildings form a cohesive family complex through their shared material palette, scale, and well-considered arrangement around an open bitumen courtyard. 1 \\nThe open courtyard affords the surrounding buildings natural ventilation and light, views between, to, and from the buildings, and clear space for pedestrian circulation. Later covered steel-framed walkways and shade structures are not of state-level heritage significance. 1 \\nAttractive views to the buildings are had from Palmerin and Victoria Streets and the buildings are highly visible within the townscape from surrounding vantage points. The grounds are well-established and include a mature front garden on Palmerin Street symmetrically laid out in front of Block A, and featuring concrete paths and garden beds with original granite edging, twin cypress pines at the front boundary, lawn, and shrubbery. 1 \\nBlock A is a highly-intact symmetrical, two-storey masonry teaching building. H-shaped in plan, it has well-composed elevations comprising a granite base, face brick walls on the lower level and a stucco upper level. It has a tall hipped roof clad in tiles with ventilated eaves and a prominent metal ventilation fleche. Large, timber-framed, double-hung windows with stone lintels are regularly spaced around all sides. The front entrance is emphasised by elaborate sandstone dressings and a striking carved stone school emblem. A small entrance vestibule retains an early iron security shutter, encaustic tessellated floor tiles, and a large clear-finished timber and glazed front door with glazed fanlight. 1 \\nThe internal layout of both levels is similar, retaining original rendered partitions and wing walls with scribed skirting board line and timber ceiling lining and cornice. Timber window and door architraves, as well as window hardware survives. The ground floor layout comprises a short entrance hall which leads to a perpendicular hallway with teaching rooms opening on either side. A wide concrete stair stands at the rear  of the building with an iron balustrade and moulded, clear-finished timber handrail. It provides access to the first floor, which has a similar layout. Few openings have been made in the original plaster partitions on both levels, however, lightweight partitions  have been inserted to make former large classrooms into smaller administration and teaching spaces. The building has timber floor framing generally with suspended concrete slab floors in the circulation spaces with Linoleum and carpet floors  placed over. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include:\\nA highly-intact, two-storey toilet block stands to the rear  of Block A, connected by a short first floor timber-framed walkway. The walkway retains V-jointed  timber board ceiling lining, post brackets, balustrade and lattice. The toilet block has face brick and stucco walls, highset timber-framed windows and a hipped roof clad in tiles. An original metal fire escape stair is attached to the rear  wall, and a half-buried concrete septic tank  stands immediately south of the toilet block. 1 \\nBlock B is a highly-intact, two-storey, symmetrical, masonry building, formerly used for manual training workshops. It has face brick and roughcast stucco walls with brick quoining to the corners and a tall hipped roof clad in tiles with vented timber louvered gablets. Timber-framed double hung windows with stone sills are regularly-spaced on all sides: some have been closed up to accommodate construction of the North Connecting Wing. The ground floor is a suspended concrete slab and the first floor is timber-framed, supported on large steel I beams stamped DORMAN LONG + CO LTD - MIDDLESBOROUGH - ENGLAND. The building includes an early roughcast stucco and brick chimney, a gantry crane on the roof above the large first floor doors, and white tuck pointing survives on some walls. 1 \\nA timber-framed verandah runs along the east side  with original small weatherboard-clad enclosures at the south end on both levels . The enclosures have early but not original timber-framed casement windows. The remaining verandah has been enclosed and a wide stair added on the first floor: these later alterations are not of state-level heritage significance. 1 \\nA small single storey face brick annexe with skillion roof  is attached to the building on its west side. 1 \\nThe internal layout of the building comprises a single large former workshop space on the first floor, whilst the ground floor has been divided into smaller spaces. 1 \\nThe original stairs have been demolished and access to the first floor is via a stair in the adjacent North Connecting Wing and via a recent external stair on the west side of the building. A stage has been inserted at one end of the first floor. The external stair and stage are not of state-level heritage significance. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include: 1 \\nBlock C is a highly-intact, two-storey, symmetrical masonry teaching building with a tall hipped roof clad with tiles, ventilated eaves, and a prominent metal ventilation fleche. It has a granite base, face brick and roughcast stucco walls, and smooth-finished concrete dressings with ground floor quoining to corners and windows. The building faces north and has a projecting central bay, which accommodates toilets and teachers rooms. This is flanked by two entrances sheltered by tiled awnings with large timber doors with glazing. The north and south elevations feature large regularly-spaced banks of timber-framed casement windows with awning fanlights. Toothed bricks on the south corners indicate planned but unbuilt extensions. The building has concrete floors in the circulation spaces and toilets, and timber-framed floors in the classrooms and teachers rooms. 1 \\nThe internal layout of both floors comprises a central corridor that runs from east to west and provides access to rooms on either side: a series of standard width classrooms  on the south side, and bathrooms and teachers rooms on the north. At either end of the corridor is a concrete stair with iron balustrade and timber handrail. The classrooms of the ground floor have had the folding partitions between classrooms replaced with fixed partitions, which are not of state-level heritage significance. Doors and windows in the ground floor verandah wall have been removed. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include: 1 \\nThe South Connecting Wing is a highly-intact two-storey teaching building linking Blocks A and C. It is L-shaped in plan and has a tall hipped roof clad with tiles, and has ventilated eaves. It has a hybrid concrete, steel I-beam, and timber structure. It faces east to Palmerin Street with face brick and roughcast stucco walls, a recessed ground floor entrance with panelled timber doors emphasised by freestone quoining, and pairs of timber-framed double-hung windows. 1 \\nThe south elevation has face brick walls and is extensively glazed with banks of timber-framed awning windows with fanlights and crimped metal sheet spandrel panels. 1 \\nA timber-framed first floor verandah runs along the inner side  of the building, connecting with the circulation spaces of Blocks A and C. Bagracks form the balustrade which is clad in crimped metal sheets and has been enclosed later with aluminium-framed windows that are not of heritage significance. The verandah wall is rendered and has timber-framed double-hung windows with brick sills. 1 \\nThe layout of both floors comprises classrooms and former storerooms to the south of the verandah, with a former medical room  and teacher's room  to the east. A short front entry hall with concrete floor has a concrete stair with steel balustrade and timber handrail up to the first floor. One partition between classrooms on the first floor has been removed. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include: 1 \\nThe North Connecting Wing is a two-storey teaching building connecting Blocks A and B. It is a long narrow building with a shallow-pitched skillion roof clad with metal sheets. Its long sides face north and south and are extensively glazed with banks of timber-framed awning windows with fanlights and a crimped metal sheet spandrel. At the west and east end of the building is a face brick stairwell with large steel-framed windows with wired glass. The building fronts Victoria Street with an entrance comprising a concrete apron and timber-framed double doors with glazing. An original entrance awning has been demolished and replaced with a larger steel awning. This and other awnings and an adjacent fence are later and not of state-level heritage significance. 1 \\nThe first floor is supported on steel open-web trusses on concrete columns exposed within the ground floor rooms, however, some columns have been removed. The layout is not intact, with its original partitions mostly demolished and new partitions inserted to a different configuration. Wall linings and first floor ceiling linings are not original. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include: 1 \\nBlock D is an intact two-storey teaching building extending from the west end of Block C. It is long and narrow with its long sides facing north and south and has a gable roof clad with metal sheets. The first floor is supported on a hybrid system of steel open web trusses on concrete columns  exposed within the ground floor spaces, and steel beams and posts . The ground floor comprises an open play area and a large toilet and showers block. A stair at the west end of the building provides access up to the first floor. The first floor comprises a verandah running along the north side providing access to a series of former science classrooms on the south side. The verandah has square timber posts and a solid balustrade clad with flat sheets. The ground floor has face brick and roughcast stucco walls between concrete columns with high-level windows of glass louvres with face brick sills. The play area has a concrete floor and is shielded by a patterned breeze block wall. The first floor walls are flat sheets with cover strips and the long sides are extensively glazed with louvres and fixed glass. The eaves are ventilated. In 2018 the roof ridge is conventional and does not have ventilators as shown in original drawings; t is not evident if these were ever built. 139  1 \\nThe layout of the ground floor toilets and showers is highly intact, with masonry partitions dividing the large space into separate boys and girls toilets, change rooms, and showers, staff toilets, janitor room, and cleaner room. The floors are concrete. The ceilings and trusses are lined with recent corrugated metal sheets, which are not of heritage significance. 1 \\nThe first floor classrooms are separated by narrow former preparation rooms which directly access classrooms. Partitions and the verandah ceiling are lined with flat sheets. A suspended celling has been installed in the first floor rooms, which is not of state-level heritage significance. 1 \\nFeatures of state-level heritage significance also include: 1 \\nBlock F is an intact one-storey brick veneer plumbing workshop building. It has a concrete slab floor and a steel portal frame. Its roof is clad with metal sheets and has an east facing clerestory window with metal-framed glass louvres. The eaves are lined with flat sheets. The end walls  are face brick with large double doors. The side walls  are extensively glazed with banks of steel-framed awning windows with louvre or fixed glass fanlights and crimped metal sheet-clad spandrel panel. A small gable-roofed block projects from the north elevation, accommodating a staffroom, a narrow pipe store room with door, and a materials store with double doors. Two extensions  have been added to the west side of the building. The windows along this side are mostly retained but are now internal. 1 \\nThe layout is intact, comprising two large workshops connected by a double door with glazing. The floors are concrete and walls are lined with flat sheets with D-shaped cover strips. The workshops' ceilings have been lined with corrugated metal sheet, which is not of state-level heritage significance. The workshops retain early timber-framed work benches. 1 \\nWarwick State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 June 2018 having satisfied the following criteria. 1 \\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\\nWarwick State High School  is important in demonstrating the provision and evolution of state and technical education and its associated architecture in Queensland. It retains excellent, representative examples of government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. 1 \\nWarwick State High School is an early example of a state funded education institution of regional importance, which has been at the forefront of the provision of secondary and technical education in Queensland, as demonstrated by Technical College and High School Buildings, Main Building, Block A  and Workshops Block, Block B ; and Queensland's second purpose-built intermediate school building, Block C . 1 \\nLater high school buildings  are excellent representations of the continuum of years of experimentation with natural light, classroom size, and ventilation by the Department of Public Works  to produce an ideal educational environment. 1 \\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\\nWarwick State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state high school and technical college complex developed from the early to the mid-20th century. The principal characteristics include: high quality, durable buildings designed by the DPW; separate buildings for specialist departments with subject-specific classrooms; classrooms and buildings for vocational education; classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation facilitated by open space around the buildings; separate toilet blocks/areas; and prominent gardens on the main street close to the centre of town. 1 \\nBlock A , the Technical College and High School classroom building, demonstrates the principal characteristics of an early 20th century state  technical college and high school teaching building in Queensland. It is highly intact retaining its: custom design in a confident classical style; landscaped front grounds and grand facade prominent on Palmerin Street; high quality materials and craftsmanship; a variety of classroom spaces designed for specialist classes; an attached separate toilet block. 1 \\nBlock B , the Workshops Block, demonstrates the principal characteristics of an early 20th century state technical college and high school workshops building in Queensland. It is highly intact retaining its: restrained style and material use complementary to the main building; location standing separate from the main building to minimise noise disruption and dissipate heat from the forges and kiln; large open workshop spaces with minimal and durable internal finishes; large door access and gantry crane to the first floor; and kiln room  with chimney. 1 \\nBlock C , the Intermediate School building, demonstrates the principal characteristics of a state intermediate school building from the interwar period in Queensland. It is highly intact retaining its: confident classical style with well-composed elevations; high quality materials and craftsmanship; a series of south-facing classrooms of a standard size with high levels of southern light and natural ventilation; and teachers rooms. 1 \\nBlock F , the high school Plumbing Workshops building, demonstrates the principal characteristics of a state high school vocational training building from the mid-20th century in Queensland. It is highly intact retaining its: location standing separate from the main building to minimise noise disruption; brick veneer, concrete slab on ground, and steel portal frame construction with vented clerestory; large open workshop spaces with minimal and durable internal finishes; large door access; and high levels of natural light and ventilation. 1 \\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\\nWarwick State High School  is highly intact and has external aesthetic significance for its beautiful attributes. This well composed complex of two-storey masonry buildings is unified by the harmonious form, scale, materials, and fine craftsmanship, laid out around an open courtyard setting with views between buildings.

He gained some notoriety when he was kidnapped in 1934.\\nGettle was originally from Oklahoma, and moved to Bakersfield, California, in 1915,where he worked for JCPenney and invested in oil fields. The 1920 United States Census showed he was living in Kern, California. 1  At the time of the kidnapping, Gettle weighed 500 pounds, 2  and he and his handicapped wife Fleeta had four children, all of whom were under 10 years of age. 3  4  One of their neighbors was comedian Joe E. Brown. 5  According to the Los Angeles Times, he was worth around \\$3,500,000. 6 \\nGettle threw a house-warming party on the evening of May 9, 1934, and was drinking with \\\"a friend named Wolf\\\" in the pool house when two men entered and escorted them out at gunpoint. Gettle was forced into a waiting automobile, and Wolf was left at the scene, tied up but otherwise unharmed. 7 \\nWilliam Gettle was held, tied up and gagged, in the bedroom of a rented house at 4256 Rosemont Street in La Crescenta, California. 8  He later told police that his kidnappers dressed in bed sheets when talking to him so as not to reveal to him their identities. 9  He also told his rescuers that he \\\"'was not mistreated in any way' by his kidnappers.\\\" 10  A ransom of \\$60,000 was demanded for Gettle's safe release in a note sent to his lawyer; another letter was sent to Fleta Gettle, asking for an additional \\$40,000. 11  Two police officers, Chester Burris and H.P. Gearhardt, were credited with breaking the case after installing a dictograph in the house of a bank robbery suspect. Overhearing a conversation about Gettle's kidnapping, they were able to trace his whereabouts to the house on Rosemount. 12  A raid was conducted on the house on the night of May 15, 1934. Gettle was recovered the same day as the victim of another high-profile kidnapping case, six-year-old June Robles.\\nThree men were arrested in connection with the kidnapping, and were eventually convicted after entering guilty pleas in court. They were James Kirk, Larry Kerrigan and Roy Williams. 13  They were all given prison terms in San Quentin. Two women, Loretta Woody and Mona Gallighen, were also arraigned. They were eventually sent to a reformatory in Arlington, Virginia. 14  Clyde Stoddard, the owner of the sedan found in the garage of the Rosemont house, was detained for questioning. 15 \\nOn June 26, just days after his return to safety, Gettle received two letters which threatened to blow up his home unless he paid the senders \\$6,000. 16  The threat was explained in the letters as 'atonement' for Gettle's testimony against Woody and Gallighen. He received another note, threatening another kidnapping, shortly before Christmas that same year. 17 \\nFourteen months after William's return, Fleeta Gettle died at the age of 34 on July 2, 1935.

\\nTicketbis業務在EUSTA制定的守則下運行，與其他傳統經濟領域一樣，人們對於門票二級市場進行法律規範的呼聲也越來越高。\\n支持者認為門票二手交易市場的存在僅僅是一個中性市場的體現，利用市場的效率讓買賣雙方各取所需。 “門票永遠也不會自己跑到二手市場中去，除非被人自願按照賣家的報價買走。” 11  而且，當這些空座位被人坐上以後，主辦方也會在紀念品銷售或特許商品經營方面因此受益。 10  12 \\n另一方面，在二手市場中，由於賣家可以自由設定價格，因此可能會利用門票短缺的情況來牟取暴利 13 ， 比如一些門票的出售價格甚至比面值高達300%，因而對買家經濟利益造成一定損害。 14  15 \\nTicketbis的活動在大眾和媒體之間的評價頗具爭議。公司獲得了部分媒體的支持，但一些持消極態度的用戶則認為這種銷售模式類似詐騙。\\n部分國際上的媒體認為Ticketbis為用戶提供了一個安全的交易平台，實際上是有助於對抗非法販賣的，特別針對一些熱門足球賽，當用戶急需門票時，可以作為一個有安全保障的中介平台為其提供選擇。 16 \\n他們聲稱Ticketbis的此類模式是在全球化協作和共享經濟的背景下誕生的，其他一些類似的新型公司還包括有 bookcrossing, couchsurfing, Bluemove, Airbnb等。 17   18 \\n另一方面，有一些用戶認為Ticketbis的行為涉嫌欺詐，主要問題是過高的門票價格，而且缺少可以直接聯繫Ticktebis的電話號碼。在eKomi, TuQuejaSuma 和 Trustpilot（页面存档备份，存于互联网档案馆） 這些網站上都有類似的抱怨和評價。\\nTicketbis公司則宣稱保障每一筆交易的安全並許諾門票都會真實有效。對於價格的差異，解釋說是因為用戶可以自由得設定價格。 19 \\n\" => \"zho\", \"水上18.2kn\\nU-505号潜艇是二战期间德国海军建造的德国IX型潜艇。她于1944年6月4日被美国海军俘虏。\\n在纳粹德国海军服役时，她曾在巡逻中成为“二战中受损最严重并成功返回港口的U型潜艇”。 3 她于1944年6月4日被美国海军22.3特遣队  俘虏，这是二战期间盟军俘获的六艘U型潜艇之一。被俘后，这艘潜艇被秘密拖到百慕大，她的船员被关押在美国战俘营，在那里他们被拒绝接受国际红十字会的访问。美国海军将U-505号列为最高机密，避免被德国人发现。\\n1954年，U-505号被捐赠给伊利诺伊州芝加哥市的科学与工业博物馆。她现在是作为博物馆展览船幸存下来的四艘德国二战U型潜艇之一，也是保存完整的两艘 IXC 型潜艇之一（另一艘为U-534）。\\nIXC型潜艇比最初的IXB型稍大。U-505号在水面时的排水量为1,120公噸（1,100長噸），在水下为1,232公噸（1,213長噸） 4  该型号的总长度为76.76米（251英尺10英寸） ,耐压船体长度58.75米（192英尺9英寸） ,光束为6.76米（22英尺2英寸） ，高度为9.60米（31英尺6英寸），以及4.70米（15英尺5英寸）的吃水深度。该潜艇由两台MAN M 9 V 40/46增压四冲程九缸柴油发动机提供动力，在水面上时可达到总4,400匹公制馬力（3,240千瓦特；4,340匹軸馬力），两台Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34双作用电动机，总1,000匹軸馬力（1,010匹公制馬力；750千瓦特）用于水下使用。她有两个杆身和两个1.92米（6英尺）的螺旋桨。该船能够下潜最深达230米。 4 \\n该型号的最大水面速度为18.3節（33.9公里每小時；21.1英里每小時），最大水下速度为7.3節（13.5公里每小時；8.4英里每小時）。 4 在水下，该船可以4節（7.4公里每小時；4.6英里每小時）的速度航行63海里（117公里；72英里）；浮出水面时，她可以以10節（19公里每小時；12英里每小時）的速度航行13,450海里（24,910公里；15,480英里）。U-505号配备了六个53.3 cm（21英寸）的鱼雷发射管（四个安装在船头，两个安装在船尾），22枚鱼雷，一门舰炮，配备180发炮弹，和一门3.7 cm（1.5英寸）SK C/30以及C/30高射炮。 4 \\nU-505号的龙骨于1940年6月12日由德意志造船厂在德国汉堡的295号码头建造完成。整体建造完成后于1941年5月25日下水，8月26日正式服役。U-505号的首任舰长是阿克塞尔-奥拉夫·洛威 (Axel-Olaf Loewe)上尉。1942年9月6日，洛威被解职，接任者彼得·日切赫（Peter Zschech)在执行任务中自杀死亡。保罗·梅尔（Paul Meyer）上尉代理了大约两周的舰长，直到11月8日他被解职。梅尔的职位最终被兰奇（Harald Lange）上尉接手，他在1944年6月4日被捕之前一直指挥这艘船。\\nU-505号在她的职业生涯中共进行了12次巡逻，击沉了8艘船，总吨数为45005。在被击沉的船中有三艘为美国船，两艘英国船，一艘挪威船，一艘荷兰船和一艘哥伦比亚船。\\nU-505号在1941年8月26日至1942年1月31日和4U艇舰队进行训练演习后，于1942年2月1日被编入2U艇舰队。她于1月19日从基尔开始了她的第一次巡逻，当时她仍在接受战斗训练。2月3日，她绕不列颠群岛航行了16天，最终停靠在法国的洛里昂。在巡逻期间她没有与敌舰交战，也没有受到攻击。 5 \\nU-505号于1942年2月11日离开洛里昂开始了她的第二次巡逻任务。在86天内，她前往非洲西海岸，在那里击沉了她的第一艘船。接下来，在不到一个月的时间里，U-505号击沉了四艘船，分别为：英国Benmohr号、挪威的Sydhav号、美国的West Irmo号和荷兰的Alphacca号，共计25041吨。4月18日，U-505号在大西洋中部遭到盟军飞机的袭击，但几乎没有受损。 6 \\n1942年6月7日，U-505号离开母港洛里昂后开始执行第三次巡逻任务。她在加勒比海击沉了美国船只Sea Thrush号和Thomas McKean号以及哥伦比亚的乌鲁斯（Urious）号。 7  乌鲁斯号是一艘属于哥伦比亚外交官的帆船，因此它的沉没为哥伦比亚提供了对德国宣战的政治依据。 8  U-505号巡逻80天后于8月25日返回洛里昂。在本次巡逻中，U-505号并没有受到攻击。 9 \\nU-505号的第四次巡逻的地点是南美洲北部海岸。她于1942年10月4日离开洛里昂，并于11月7日在委内瑞拉海岸击沉了英国船只“海洋正义”号。 11月10日在特立尼达附近海域，U-505号被皇家空军第53中队的洛克希德哈德逊海上巡逻机发现，巡逻机对浮在水面上的U-505号进行了低空攻击，并投放了一枚250磅（110公斤）的炸弹，这枚炸弹击中水位以上的甲板，当场炸死了一名警卫，炸伤了指挥塔中的另一名船员。爆炸还将高射炮从其支架上砸下来，并严重损坏了该船的耐压船体。由于爆炸非常猛烈，这架巡逻机也被弹片击中，坠入附近的海里，导致飞行员罗纳德·西尔科克  中士及全体机组人员死亡。由于U-505号的水泵在爆炸中受损，水淹没了几个地方的机舱。船长命令船员弃船，但一名技术人员（首席军士Otto Fricke）坚持要留在船上继续维修。经过近两周的维修工作，该船的水密功能恢复。在将受伤的值班船员转移到U-462后，U-505号以低速一瘸一拐地返回洛里昂。 10 \\n在洛里昂进行六个月维修后，U-505号开始了她的第五次巡逻。她于1943年7月1日离开洛里昂，13天后返回，此次巡逻中，U-505号遭到3艘英军驱逐舰追击。虽然U-505号在这次遭遇战中没有受到严重损伤，但她不得不返回法国母港进行维修。 11  U-505号接下来的四个巡逻任务由于设备故障和法国抵抗组织的破坏而不得不终止。 12   13   14   15 被发现的故障包括电机和雷达设备损坏、法国工人故意在柴油燃料箱上钻洞，以及修理的零件焊缝有问题。由于这种情况时常发生，以至于U-505号成了整个洛里昂基地的笑话。 16 \\n在洛里昂待了10个月后，U-505号出发前往大西洋执行她的第十次巡逻任务，试图打破她的厄运和士气低落的局面。英国驱逐舰于1943年10月24日在亚速尔群岛以东发现了她，在穿越比斯开湾后不久，她被迫潜入水中并经受了一次严重的深水炸弹袭击。在袭击期间，舰长彼得·日切赫在潜艇控制室当着船员的面开枪自杀。第一值班军官保罗·迈耶（Paul Meyer）接手指挥，将船以最小的损坏返回港口。德国海军为此事件“免除了迈耶的所有责任”。 17   18  日切赫被记录为在战争期间唯一一位在水下自杀的潜艇艇员。 18 \\n在日切赫死后，哈罗德·兰奇上尉成为了该舰的新任指挥官。U-505号的第十次巡逻始于1943年的圣诞日。12月28日，U-505号从在比斯开湾被英军击沉的舰艇中救出33名船员后返回洛里昂。 19 \\n盟军从破译的德军情报中获悉，U型潜艇将在佛得角附近巡逻，但并未得知它们的确切位置。 21   17 美国海军派出了22.3特遣队前往该地区，这是一个由丹尼尔·V·加莱瑞上尉指挥的“猎人-杀手”小组。TG 22.3由护航航空母舰瓜达尔卡纳尔号和由弗雷德里克·霍尔指挥的驱逐舰Pillsbury、Pope、Flaherty、Chatelain号和Jenks号。 22 该小组于1944年5月15日从弗吉尼亚州诺福克出发，并于5月下旬开始在该地区使用高频定向定位（“Huff-Duff”）及空中和地面侦察寻找U型潜艇。\\n1944年6月4日11:09，TG 22.3在21°30′N 19°20′W  /  21.500°N 19.333°W  / 21.500; -19.333  使用声纳探测到了U-505号的准确位置（离Río de Oro海岸约280公里）。 21 距离U-505号最近的查特莱兰号立即向定位点移动，而瓜达尔卡纳尔号以最高速度紧追，一架格鲁曼F4F野猫战斗机从航母上起飞，加入提前起飞的另一架野猫和一架TBF复仇者轰炸机。 23 \\n查克兰号离U-505号非常近，以至于深水炸弹下沉的速度不足以拦截U型潜艇，因此她在经过潜艇并转身用深水炸弹进行后续攻击之前发射了刺猬迫击炮。 21 此时在空中的一架飞机发现了U-505号并向水中开火以标记位置，而查克兰号则投下了深水炸弹。炸弹爆炸后立即在水面上蔓延了一大片浮油，战斗机飞行员用无线电说：“潜艇浮出水面！” 24 在查特兰号的第一次攻击开始后不到七分钟，这艘严重受损的潜艇在不远处浮出水面。 23  查特兰号立即用所有可用的武器向它开火，特遣队的其他船只和两艘野猫战斗机也加入了进来。 21 \\n舰长兰格认为U-505号受到损坏已经无法修复，并命令他的船员弃船。船员们服从了命令，但没有将船凿沉；他们打开了一些阀门，但发动机还在继续运转。 21 船舵被深水炸弹损坏，所以潜艇以大约7節（13公里每小時；8.1英里每小時）的速度原地打转。查特兰号的指挥官看到潜艇仍在转向，认为她仍有战斗力，于是下令向U-505号发射一枚鱼雷；鱼雷未击中，从U-505号的前方擦过。 21 \\n美军从海面上救起了幸存者，由Albert David中尉率领的8人小组乘船来到潜艇旁边，并通过指挥塔进入。他们在甲板上发现了一等信号员Gottfried Fischer的尸体，这是战斗中唯一的阵亡水兵。美军在潜艇里获得了海图和密码本。美军工程师阻止了进水，使潜艇继续漂浮在水中。 21  U艇研究员德里克·沃勒  写道，德国船员埃瓦尔德·费利克斯  帮助挫败了凿沉企图。 25 \\n美国海军将U-505号保存在位于百慕大的美国海军作战基地，海军情报人员和工程师对其进行了深入研究。为了使德国人产生U-505号已经被击沉而不是被俘的错觉，她被涂得看起来像一艘美国潜艇并被更名为尼莫号。 26 在欧洲战事结束时，U-505号被用来促进E战争债券的销售，作为“强大的 7th”战争贷款活动的一部分。任何购买债券的人也可以购买一张船票来登船参观。1945年6月，U-505号访问了纽约、费城和巴尔的摩。 27 \\n战后，美国海军不再使用U-505号。专家在百慕大对她进行了彻底检查，并将该船遗弃在朴茨茅斯海军造船厂，因此海军决定将她用作射击和鱼雷练习的目标，直到她沉没。 21  1946年，反对海军U-505号计划的海军少将加纳利告诉他的兄弟约翰·加纳利这个计划，约翰神父联系了芝加哥科学与工业博物馆 的主席莱诺克斯·洛尔，询问博物馆是否对它感兴趣。博物馆已经计划展示一艘潜艇，购买U-505号似乎很理想。 21 美国政府于1954年9月将潜艇捐赠给博物馆，芝加哥居民筹集了25万美元用于运输和安装潜艇。1954年7月，海岸警卫队的拖船将船拖过五大湖。 28 博物馆于1954年9月25日将其作为永久展览和战争纪念碑，以纪念在第一次和第二次大西洋海战中丧生的所有水手。\\nU-505号抵达博物馆时，几乎所有可拆卸部件都已从船内被拆走。所以博物馆馆长洛尔要求德国制造商提供替代品，这些制造商提供了该船的原始零部件以作为展览用。海军上将加纳利在他的自传中说，每家德国公司都愿意免费提供所需的零件。大多数信件都表明制造商希望她成为德国先进技术的体现。 29 \\n1964年，也就是这艘船被俘虏20年后，博物馆举行了一次聚会，加纳利在那里将一套属于船长的双筒望远镜归还给了蘭奇。 30 \\n\" => \"zho\", \"《Video Star》（韓語：비디오스타）是于2016年7月12日起在MBC有线频道MBC every1（朝鲜语：MBC 에브리원）中播出的脱口秀节目。《Video Star》是MBC电视台播出的《Radio
